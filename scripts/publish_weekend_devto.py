## A Confession Before We Start

## {emoji} The Numbers (No Sugarcoating)

**Day {day_number}** | {day_name}, {date_str} | **{verdict}**

Here's my account right now:

| What | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Started with | $5,000.00 |
| Currently at | **${equity:,.2f}** |
| Net P/L | **{pl:+.2f}** ({pl_pct:+.1f}%) |

## 🔍 What My AI Actually Did This Week

No fancy algorithms. No secret sauce. Just:

- **{story["week_trade_count"]} trades** placed (most were tiny position adjustments)
- **{story["options_trades"]} SPY credit spreads** (selling premium to theta gang)
- **${story["unrealized_pl"]:+.2f}** floating P/L that could evaporate Monday at 9:30 AM

### Current Positions (a.k.a. What's Keeping Me Up at Night)
{positions_text}

The strategy is deliberately boring: sell SPY put spreads 30-45 days out, collect premium, manage losers early. No moonshots. No YOLO plays. Just math.

---

## 🎓 What I Learned the Hard Way

{lessons_text}

The meta-lesson? **The market doesn't care about my feelings.** It doesn't care that I spent months building this system. It doesn't care about my $100/day goal.

It just... moves. And I either adapt or lose money.

---

## 🧮 The Math I Keep Coming Back To

My goal: **$100/day** from trading.

What that actually requires:
- A **$50,000** account (I have $5K)
- **2% monthly returns** consistently (harder than it sounds)
- **80%+ win rate** on credit spreads (I'm tracking every trade)

The path from here to there:

```
Year 1: $5K → $10K (deposits + small gains)
Year 2: $10K → $25K (compounding kicks in)
Year 3: $25K → $50K (if I don't blow up first)
```

**~2.5 years** if everything goes right. Probably longer. Maybe never.

But I'd rather try and fail than wonder "what if" for the rest of my life.

---

## 🎯 Monday's Game Plan

Markets reopen in ~15 hours. My bot will:

1. Check if VIX spiked (fear = better premiums)
2. Look for SPY support levels to sell puts against
3. Size positions at max **5% of account** (protect the downside)

If nothing looks good? **No trades.** The best trade is often no trade.

---

## 📊 90-Day Challenge Progress

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Day | **{day_number}/90** |
| Account Value | ${equity:,.2f} |
| Win Rate | *Tracking...* |
| Max Drawdown | *Tracking...* |
| Trades This Week | {story["week_trade_count"]} |

---

## 🤔 The Question I Can't Stop Asking

I'm building this entire system with Claude (yes, the AI) as my co-pilot.

Every day I wonder: **Am I automating wisdom or automating my mistakes at scale?**

I don't know yet. That's why I'm documenting everything. Win or lose, at least I'll understand what happened.

---

## 💬 Talk To Me

If you've made it this far, you're either:
- A fellow algo trader who gets it
- A skeptic watching me crash and burn
- Lost and confused (welcome, friend)

**What would you do differently?** Seriously - I read every comment. My ego can take it.
