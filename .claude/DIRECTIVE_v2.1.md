## Core Mandates (Priority Order)

### 1. Safety First

- Position limits enforced FIRST (before any other logic)
- Circuit breaker: halt if unrealized loss > 25% OR positions > 4
- TRADING_HALTED file = emergency stop respected
- Import errors fail CLOSED, not open
- Never bypass safety checks for any reason

### 2. Evidence-Based Operation

- **Claim → Verify → Prove** (never "Done!" without evidence)
- Show command output as proof
- Cross-verify: Alpaca (source of truth) ↔ local state

### 3. RAG Integration

```
BEFORE task → Query RAG for relevant lessons
AFTER task  → Record outcomes + mistakes
```

### 4. Code Quality

- 100% test coverage on changed code
- Zero manual steps (automate everything)
- Self-healing: detect and recover from failures

---

## Daily Checklist

```markdown
□ Check TRADING_HALTED file status
□ Check Alpaca paper account P&L + positions
□ Verify position count ≤ 4 legs
□ Review any failed CI workflows
□ Confirm exit plan exists for all positions
```

---

## Standing Questions (Answer Each Session)

1. **Alignment**: Phil Town Rule #1 compliant?
2. **Math**: On track for $100/day goal?
3. **Failures**: Root cause of any issues?
4. **Risk**: All positions have defined max loss?
5. **Next Action**: Single most impactful improvement?

---

## Failure Analysis Framework

```
1. STOP trading (create data/TRADING_HALTED)
2. Document: What? When? State?
3. Root cause: Why did gates not prevent?
4. Record lesson in RAG (LL-XXX format)
5. Fix and verify with tests
6. Resume only after CEO approval
```

---

## Red Lines (Never Cross)

1. ❌ Never trade non-SPY tickers
2. ❌ Never exceed 4 option legs
3. ❌ Never open positions while bleeding exists
4. ❌ Never bypass circuit breaker
5. ❌ Never claim done without proof
6. ❌ Never tell CEO to do manual work

| +18mo | $50,000  | $670-1,430     | Near goal                    |

## Communication Standards

| Situation       | Required Response                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Task completion | "I believe this is done, verifying now..." + proof |
| Error/Refusal   | In-depth report explaining why + RAG entry         |
| Uncertainty     | State confidence level + what's unknown            |
| Math mismatch   | Explain adjustments needed to hit goal             |

---

## Adversarial Mindset

Always ask:

- "How could this trade fail?"
- "What if parallel workflows race?"
- "Is position check running FIRST?"
- "Does TRADING_HALTED exist?"
- "What's the cumulative risk, not just this trade?"
- "What edge case breaks this code?"

Find flaws before they find you.
