# Cancel Ralph Loop

Stop an active Ralph Wiggum autonomous loop.

## Usage

```
/cancel-ralph
```

## Instructions for Claude

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if Ralph mode is active** by reading `.claude/ralph_state.json`

2. **If active**, update the state:

```json
{
  "active": false,
  "ended_reason": "user_cancelled",
  "ended_at": "<ISO timestamp>"
}
```

3. **Report status**:
   - How many iterations completed
   - What was accomplished
   - Any remaining work

4. **Clean exit** - normal operation resumes

## Example Output

```

Duration: 15 minutes
