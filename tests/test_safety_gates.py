Safety Gate Tests - Comprehensive Validation Suite

Implements recommended safety tests from Dec 11, 2025 analysis:
1. Assumption Validation - Verify data stationarity
2. Slippage Simulation - Monte Carlo drag testing
3. Gate Stress - Fuzz thresholds to measure false rejects
4. Execution Integrity - Signal→Order→Receipt verification
5. Drawdown Circuit - Halt verification on >5% intraday
6. Telemetry Audit - Anomaly detection in funnel logs

Run before merges to catch 80% of pitfalls.
