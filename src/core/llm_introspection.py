"""
LLM Introspective Awareness Module for Trading System

Implements self-assessment and epistemic uncertainty tracking based on
Anthropic's research on emergent introspective awareness in LLMs.

Key Features:
- Self-consistency checking (multiple reasoning paths)
- Epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty distinction
- Self-critique and calibration layer
- Confidence aggregation across multiple signals
- Hallucination detection via Reversing Chain-of-Thought (RCoT)

Reference: https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection

Example:
    >>> introspector = LLMIntrospector(analyzer)
    >>> result = await introspector.analyze_with_introspection(market_data)
    >>> print(f"Confidence: {result.aggregate_confidence}")
    >>> print(f"Epistemic uncertainty: {result.epistemic_uncertainty}")
