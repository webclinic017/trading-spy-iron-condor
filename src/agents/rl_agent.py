"""
RL Filter - Linear Feature Scoring Model

Status: ACTIVE (Jan 26, 2026 - ML-IMP-1)
Uses pre-trained weights from models/ml/rl_filter_weights.json

Implementation:
- Linear scoring: score = bias + sum(weight_i * feature_i)
- Action threshold: if score > threshold -> "enter", else "hold"
- SPY-specific weights for optimized trading

Features used:
- strength: Signal strength (momentum indicator)
- momentum: Short-term momentum
- rsi_gap: RSI deviation from neutral (50)
- volume_premium: Volume vs average
- sma_ratio: Price vs SMA ratio
- atr_normalized: Normalized ATR (volatility)
- adx_normalized: Trend strength (ADX)
- di_difference: Directional indicator difference

The RLHF feedback model (models/ml/feedback_model.json) continues to learn
from user feedback using Thompson Sampling.
