## Backtesting & Risk-Adjusted Returns

### Sharpe Ratio Analysis

The **Sharpe Ratio** measures risk-adjusted return: how much excess return we get per unit of risk.

| Metric            | Value    | Interpretation                    |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Sharpe Ratio**  | **2.00** | Excellent (institutional quality) |
| **Sortino Ratio** | 3.74     | Downside risk-adjusted            |
| **Profit Factor** | 1.60     | Gross profit / Gross loss         |
| **Max Drawdown**  | 4.6%     | Worst peak-to-trough decline      |

### Backtest Performance

| Metric           | Value               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Total Trades** | 6                   |
| **Win Rate**     | 33.3%               |
| **Strategy**     | Iron Condors on SPY |

### Our Backtesting Methodology

1. **Historical Data**: We use Alpaca's historical options data with realistic IV estimation
2. **Black-Scholes Pricing**: Options priced using Black-Scholes with rolling historical volatility
3. **Slippage & Costs**: 0-5% slippage built into simulation
4. **Exit Rules**: 50% profit target, 200% stop loss, or 7 DTE exit (per LL-268)

### Strategy: Iron Condors on SPY

Our strategy sells both put spreads and call spreads on SPY:

```
Bull Put Spread (downside protection)
  └── Sell 15-delta put
  └── Buy 20-delta put ($5 wide)

Bear Call Spread (upside protection)
  └── Sell 15-delta call
  └── Buy 20-delta call ($5 wide)
```

**Why Iron Condors?**

- Collect premium from BOTH sides
- 15-delta = ~85% probability of profit
- Defined risk on both directions
- Profit when SPY stays within range

**Risk Management:**

- Max 5% of capital per trade ($248 on $5K account)
- Stop loss at 200% of credit received
- Close at 7 DTE to avoid gamma risk (LL-268: improves win rate to 80%+)

_Sharpe ratio calculated using annualized returns with 4.5% risk-free rate (current 3-month T-bill)._
