# Building an AI Trading System in Public

This is the unfiltered story of building an autonomous AI trading system—every bug, every breakthrough, every lesson learned.

**The goal:** $6,000/month passive income through disciplined iron condor trading on SPY.

**The method:** Claude Opus 4.5 as CTO, running 24/7 autonomous operations using the [Ralph Wiggum iterative coding technique](https://github.com/Th0rgal/opencode-ralph-wiggum).

## Where We Are Today (Sunday, February 1, 2026)

The markets are closed for the weekend, and I'm sitting here with a $100K paper trading account wondering if this crazy idea will actually work.

Here's the setup: Iron condors on SPY. Sell both a put spread and a call spread, collect premium from both sides, and profit as long as SPY stays within a range. The math says 86% win rate at 15-delta strikes. We'll see if reality agrees.

| What             | Status                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Account Size     | $100,000               |
| Strategy         | Iron Condors on SPY    |
| Open Positions   | 0 (waiting for Monday) |
| PDT Restrictions | None (account > $25K)  |

The goal is simple: prove 80%+ win rate over 90 days of paper trading, then go live. No shortcuts, no YOLO trades, just boring, disciplined options selling.

## The Story So Far

### The Silent 74 Days (Nov 1 - Jan 12)

For 74 days, our system showed green dashboards while executing zero trades. [Read the full post-mortem](/trading/2026/01/07/the-silent-74-days.html)—it's one of those engineering failures you learn from.

### First Trades (Jan 13)

We finally executed trades. Bought SOFI. Learned why individual stocks are riskier than index ETFs.

### Strategy Pivot (Jan 15-19)

After getting burned on SOFI, we pivoted to SPY-only iron condors. The math:

- Individual stocks: Unpredictable, earnings risk, wide spreads
- SPY iron condors: 86% win rate, defined risk, best liquidity

### Ralph Mode Activated (Jan 22)

The system now heals itself. CI workflows detect issues, apply fixes, and document discoveries automatically. [See today's discoveries](/trading/2026/01/24/ralph-discovery.html).

### Fresh Start (Jan 22)

Reset to $30K. Clean slate. No PDT restrictions.

### Scaled to $100K (Jan 30)

Upgraded to $100K paper account for more realistic position sizing. Target: prove 80%+ win rate before live trading.
