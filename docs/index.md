This is the unfiltered story of building an autonomous AI trading system—every bug, every breakthrough, every lesson learned.

**The goal:** Reach $6K/month after-tax options income as fast as safely possible through disciplined, automated execution.

**Strategy Profile:** Automated iron condor system (SPY-first; expandable to SPX/XSP/QQQ/IWM) with 15-20 delta short strikes, $10-wide wings, and up to 5 concurrent positions.

**Capital Deployment Policy:** Alpaca paper account ($100K) is the primary validation engine. Alpaca brokerage account is traded opportunistically only when the same RAG + risk gates pass.

**The method:** A full autonomous stack where each layer has a strict role:

- **Signal + market data layer**: Alpaca + macro/news inputs feed the orchestrator.
- **Decision layer**: Claude Opus handles trade-critical reasoning; TARS/OpenRouter route non-critical tasks for cost control.
- **Memory layer**: LanceDB RAG retrieves prior failures and lessons before trade and code decisions.
- **Execution layer**: Orchestrator + trade gateway enforce a liquid index-options whitelist (SPY-first; expandable to SPX/XSP/QQQ/IWM), sizing, entry/exit, and stop-loss policies before orders hit Alpaca.
- **Risk layer**: Hard gates (position limits, drawdown controls, pre-trade smoke tests, mandatory checklists) block unsafe actions.
- **Reliability layer**: Ralph Mode and CI workflows continuously test, repair, and document the system.
