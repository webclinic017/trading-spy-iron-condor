This is the unfiltered story of building an autonomous AI trading system—every bug, every breakthrough, every lesson learned.

**The goal:** An accessible automated iron condor system anyone can enter with as little as $200.

**The method:** A full autonomous stack where each layer has a strict role:

- **Signal + market data layer**: Alpaca + macro/news inputs feed the orchestrator.
- **Decision layer**: Claude Opus handles trade-critical reasoning; TARS/OpenRouter route non-critical tasks for cost control.
- **Memory layer**: LanceDB RAG retrieves prior failures and lessons before trade and code decisions.
- **Execution layer**: Orchestrator + trade gateway enforce SPY-only, sizing, entry/exit, and stop-loss policies before orders hit Alpaca.
- **Risk layer**: Hard gates (position limits, drawdown controls, pre-trade smoke tests, mandatory checklists) block unsafe actions.
- **Reliability layer**: Ralph Mode and CI workflows continuously test, repair, and document the system.

Full architecture: **[Tech Stack](/trading/tech-stack/)**.
