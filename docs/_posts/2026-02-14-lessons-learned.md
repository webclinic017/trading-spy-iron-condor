## Tech Stack Behind the Lessons

Every lesson we learn is captured, analyzed, and stored by our AI infrastructure:

        CLAUDE --> RAG["LanceDB RAG<br/>(Storage)"]

### How We Learn Autonomously

| Component | Role in Learning |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Claude Opus 4.5** | Analyzes errors, extracts insights, determines severity |
| **LanceDB RAG** | Stores lessons with 768D embeddings for semantic search |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash** | Retrieves relevant past lessons before new trades |
| **OpenRouter (DeepSeek)** | Cost-effective sentiment analysis and research |

### Why This Matters

1. **No Lesson Lost**: Every insight persists in our RAG corpus
2. **Contextual Recall**: Before each trade, we query similar past situations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: 200+ lessons shape every decision
4. **Transparent Journey**: All learnings published publicly

## The Journey So Far

We're building an autonomous AI trading system that learns from every mistake. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about building a system that can consistently generate income through disciplined options trading.

**Our approach:**
- Paper trade for 90 days to validate the strategy
- Document every lesson, every failure, every win
- Use AI (Claude) as CTO to automate and improve
- Follow Phil Town's Rule #1: Don't lose money
