Thursday was a rough day. We found two bugs that were silently eating our profits.

## Bug #1: Invalid Option Strikes ($70 loss)

**The symptom:** Our iron condors only had PUT legs. No CALLs were executing.

**The cause:** SPY options only exist in $5 increments ($720, $725, $730...), but our code was calculating strikes like $724 and $729.

```python
# The bug

## Answer Block

> **Answer Block:** Thursday was a rough day. We found two bugs that were silently eating our profits.

short_call = round(price * 1.05)  # round(690*1.05) = $724 - doesn't exist!

# The fix
def round_to_5(x): return round(x / 5) * 5
short_call = round_to_5(price * 1.05)  # = $725 - valid!
```

Alpaca silently rejected the invalid symbols. No error logs. No warning. Just... nothing.

**The lesson:** When your broker "fails silently," you need explicit validation. We now verify all 4 legs fill before considering a trade complete.

## Bug #2: Crisis Workflow Traded Shares ($22.61 loss)

**The symptom:** 49 SPY share trades appeared in our account. We don't trade shares—we trade iron condors.

**The cause:** A "crisis recovery" workflow kicked in when the main trading workflow hit credential issues. Instead of alerting us, it started buying and selling SPY shares repeatedly.

**Why this happened:**

1. GitHub secrets had wrong names (5K vs 30K accounts)
2. Iron condor workflow failed silently
3. Crisis workflow assumed "no positions = emergency" and started trading shares
4. No circuit breaker to stop runaway trades

**The fix:** Disabled all crisis workflows. Iron condors only. No automated share trading ever.

**The lesson:** Emergency fallback code is often the most dangerous code. It runs when things are already broken, making broken decisions.

## The Math

| Issue                                | Loss     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Invalid strikes (PUT-only positions) | ~$70     |
| Share churning (crisis workflow)     | $22.61   |
| **Total**                            | **~$93** |

Small in absolute terms, but these are the bugs that compound into real losses at scale.

## What We Fixed

1. **Strike rounding** - All SPY strikes now round to $5 increments
2. **Leg validation** - Trade isn't "complete" until all 4 legs fill
3. **Disabled crisis workflows** - No more automated fallbacks
4. **Circuit breaker** - Halt if >5 share trades per day
