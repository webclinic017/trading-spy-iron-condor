# Day 77 of 90 | Tuesday, January 13, 2026

**13 days remaining** in our journey to build a profitable AI trading system.

Today was a wake-up call. Two critical issues surfaced that could have derailed our entire trading operation. Here's what went wrong and how we're fixing it.

## The Hard Lessons

_These are the moments that test us. Critical issues that demanded immediate attention._

### Alpaca Does NOT Support Trailing Stops for Options

Result: **All option positions were UNPROTECTED**, violating Phil Town Rule #1.

**Key takeaway:** SOFI260130P00025000: -$7.

### Trade Gateway Rule 1 Enforcement Fixed

Trade gateway only blocked BUY orders when P/L was negative. But short puts (SELL orders on options) also increase risk and were bypassing the Rule

**Key takeaway:** CHECK 2.

### Three More Missing Test Files Blocking CI

CI workflow failing because these test files referenced in `ci.yml` do not exist:

**Key takeaway:** Removed references from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` safety-matrix job.

### Lesson LL-158: Day 74 Emergency Fix - SPY to SOFI

Day 74/90 with $0 profit in paper account. System was blocking all trades.

**Key takeaway:** Files changed: data/tier2_watchlist.

### Phil Town Rule 1 Violated - Lost $17.94 on Jan 13

Phil Town Rule

**Key takeaway:** Lost $17.

### Options Buying Power $0 Despite $5K Cash - Root Cause

74 days into trading, $0 profit. Paper account has $5,000 cash but options_buying_power shows $0. All CSP orders are rejected. System appears operational but executes zero trades.

**Key takeaway:** 1. MANUAL INTERVENTION: Cancel ALL open orders via Alpaca dashboard

### Repeated Rule 1 Violation - Still Holding Losing Positions

Despite having 26 lessons in RAG about Rule

**Key takeaway:** Phil Town Rule #1.

### Prevent Duplicate Short Positions

This would have DOUBLED the risk exposure by selling another put on the same contract.

**Key takeaway:** Position: SOFI260206P00024000 (short 1 put at $0.

### Missing Test Files Blocking ALL Trading

Daily Trading workflow failing because `tests/test_telemetry_summary.py` and `tests/test_fred_collector.py` referenced in workflows but files DO NOT EXIST. This caused 74+ days of ZERO trades.

**Key takeaway:** Removed references to non-existent test files from:

## Important Discoveries

_Not emergencies, but insights that will shape how we trade going forward._

### Placeholder Tests Removed for Honesty

Removed 14 placeholder tests that only contained `assert True`. These provided false coverage metrics and violated the "Never lie" directive.

### Dialogflow Webhook Missing Vertex AI - Only Local Keyword...

Dialogflow webhook was falling back to local keyword search instead of using Vertex AI semantic search. CEO saw "Based on our lessons learned (local search):" instead of synthesized answers from Gemin

### Comprehensive CEO Review - Technical Debt Audit & Critica...

CEO requested comprehensive review of system health, strategy math, and technical debt.

## Tech Stack Behind the Lessons

Every lesson we learn is captured, analyzed, and stored by our AI infrastructure:

### How We Learn Autonomously

| Component                 | Role in Learning                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Opus 4.5**       | Analyzes errors, extracts insights, determines severity |
| **Vertex AI RAG**         | Stores lessons with 768D embeddings for semantic search |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash**      | Retrieves relevant past lessons before new trades       |
| **OpenRouter (DeepSeek)** | Cost-effective sentiment analysis and research          |

### Why This Matters

1. **No Lesson Lost**: Every insight persists in our RAG corpus
2. **Contextual Recall**: Before each trade, we query similar past situations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: 200+ lessons shape every decision
4. **Transparent Journey**: All learnings published publicly

## The Journey So Far

We're building an autonomous AI trading system that learns from every mistake. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about building a system that can consistently generate income through disciplined options trading.

**Our approach:**

- Paper trade for 90 days to validate the strategy
- Document every lesson, every failure, every win
- Use AI (Claude) as CTO to automate and improve
- Follow Phil Town's Rule #1: Don't lose money
