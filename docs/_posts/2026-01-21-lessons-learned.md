# Day 85 of 90 | Wednesday, January 21, 2026

**5 days remaining** in our journey to build a profitable AI trading system.

Today was a wake-up call. Two critical issues surfaced that could have derailed our entire trading operation. Here's what went wrong and how we're fixing it.

## The Hard Lessons

_These are the moments that test us. Critical issues that demanded immediate attention._

### SOFI Position Blocked All Trading - Buying Power Crisis

1. SOFI260213P00032000 (short put) was open with -$685 market value

**Key takeaway:** 1. Triggered `close-non-spy-positions.yml` workflow

### Strategy Violation Crisis - Multiple Rogue Workflows

On Jan 21, 2026, the trading system LOST $70.13 due to executing trades that VIOLATE CLAUDE.md strategy mandate. The system bought SPY SHARES and SOFI OPTIONS when it should ONLY execute iron condors

**Key takeaway:** Portfolio: $5,028.

### Position Imbalance Crisis - Orphan Long Puts

Portfolio lost $329.42 (-6.59%) due to position imbalance:

**Key takeaway:** The orphan longs are decaying and losing money without corresponding short premium to offset.

### Partial Iron Condor Auto-Close

Iron condors were being placed with only PUT legs filling. CALL legs were failing silently, leaving dangerous directional positions:

### CTO Failure - Stale Data Led to Misinformation

CTO (Claude) gave CEO incorrect P/L information multiple times:

**Key takeaway:** Claimed $0.

### Position Limit - Count Contracts Not Symbols

The position limit check was counting UNIQUE SYMBOLS instead of TOTAL CONTRACTS:

**Key takeaway:** 3. **Log details**: Show exact positions when limit reached

## Important Discoveries

_Not emergencies, but insights that will shape how we trade going forward._

## Tech Stack Behind the Lessons

Every lesson we learn is captured, analyzed, and stored by our AI infrastructure:

    end

### How We Learn Autonomously

| Component                 | Role in Learning                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Opus 4.5**       | Analyzes errors, extracts insights, determines severity |
| **legacy RAG**         | Stores lessons with 768D embeddings for semantic search |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash**      | Retrieves relevant past lessons before new trades       |
| **OpenRouter (DeepSeek)** | Cost-effective sentiment analysis and research          |

### Why This Matters

1. **No Lesson Lost**: Every insight persists in our RAG corpus
2. **Contextual Recall**: Before each trade, we query similar past situations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: 200+ lessons shape every decision
4. **Transparent Journey**: All learnings published publicly

## The Journey So Far

We're building an autonomous AI trading system that learns from every mistake. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about building a system that can consistently generate income through disciplined options trading.

**Our approach:**

- Paper trade for 90 days to validate the strategy
- Document every lesson, every failure, every win
- Use AI (Claude) as CTO to automate and improve
- Follow Phil Town's Rule #1: Don't lose money
