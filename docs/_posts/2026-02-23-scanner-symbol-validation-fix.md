## The Problem

Our iron condor scanner picked option expirations mathematically — any Friday in the 30-45 DTE window. But Alpaca doesn't list weekly option contracts months in advance. When the scanner chose April 3, 2026 (a Friday, 39 DTE), the symbols `SPY260403P00640000` didn't exist yet.

Result: `APIError: invalid legs` on every scan for weeks. Zero trades executed.

## Root Cause

`find_expiration_date()` calculated dates without querying the broker. Weekly SPY options are only listed ~2-3 weeks before expiration. Monthly options (third Fridays) are listed months ahead.

## The Fix

Two-layer defense:

**Layer 1 — Smart Expiry Discovery**: Query Alpaca's `OptionChainRequest` API for real expirations. Only return dates where contracts actually exist. Fall back to third Fridays (monthly — always listed).

**Layer 2 — Symbol Validation**: Before submitting any order, verify all 4 OCC symbols exist via `OptionSnapshotRequest`. If any symbol is missing, abort with a clear error.

## Result

First autonomous trade in weeks submitted at 17:50 UTC on Feb 23, 2026. Both Scanner and Autonomous workflows green.

## Lesson

Never assume financial instrument availability from date math. Always validate against the broker's actual listings before constructing orders.
