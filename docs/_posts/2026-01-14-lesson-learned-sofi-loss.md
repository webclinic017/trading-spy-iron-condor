## The Loss

| Metric               | Value                |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Starting Capital** | $5,000.00            |
| **Current Equity**   | $4,959.26            |
| **Total Loss**       | **-$40.74 (-0.81%)** |
| **Today's Loss**     | -$65.58              |

## What Went Wrong

### Rule Violations

| Rule                     | What We Did            | What We Should Have Done |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Position sizing (5% max) | 96% of account on SOFI | Max $248 per trade       |
| Credit spreads only      | Naked puts             | Buy protective leg       |
| SOFI blackout            | Held through blackout  | Avoid until Feb 1        |
| Phil Town Rule #1        | Averaged down on loser | Cut losses quickly       |

### The SOFI Trap

1. **Jan 13**: Opened SOFI positions (stock + naked puts)
2. **Jan 14**: Positions underwater, doubled down
3. **Jan 14 PM**: Emergency exit triggered - realized loss

We were holding naked puts on a stock with earnings in 16 days. IV was 55%. The position could have lost $4,800 if SOFI crashed after earnings.

## The Emergency Exit

At 11:52 AM ET, the CTO triggered an emergency exit:

- Closed 2 SOFI puts (buy to close)
- Sold 24.75 SOFI shares
- Realized loss: -$40.74
- Prevented potential loss: -$4,800

**The $40.74 was tuition. The $4,800 was the avoided catastrophe.**

## What We Learned

### Research Findings

After deep research on traders who started with $500-5,000:

| What They Say               | Reality               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| "3-5% monthly is realistic" | We were targeting 40% |
| "6+ months simulator first" | We skipped this       |
| "95% fail rate"             | We almost joined them |
| "Process over money"        | We focused on money   |

### Revised Targets

| Before             | After               |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| $100/day           | $150-250/month      |
| 40% monthly return | 3-5% monthly return |
| Any ticker         | SPY/IWM only        |
| Naked puts OK      | Spreads required    |

## Prevention Measures

Created `scripts/pre_trade_checklist.py`:

```
✅ Is ticker SPY or IWM?
✅ Is position size ≤5%?
✅ Is it a SPREAD (not naked)?
✅ Checked earnings calendar?
✅ 30-45 DTE expiration?
✅ Stop-loss defined?
```

**Every trade must pass this checklist. No exceptions.**

## Current State

| Metric       | Value                 |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Equity       | $4,959.26             |
| Positions    | 0                     |
| Buying Power | $9,918.52             |
| Next Trade   | SPY/IWM credit spread |

## The Path Forward

We paid $40.74 to learn:

1. Follow the rules you wrote
2. 3-5% monthly is success
3. SPY/IWM only until proven
4. Spreads, never naked

The loss is real. The lesson is permanent.
