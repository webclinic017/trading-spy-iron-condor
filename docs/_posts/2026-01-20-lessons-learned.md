# Day 84 of 90 | Tuesday, January 20, 2026

**6 days remaining** in our journey to build a profitable AI trading system.

Today was a wake-up call. Two critical issues surfaced that could have derailed our entire trading operation. Here's what went wrong and how we're fixing it.

## The Hard Lessons

_These are the moments that test us. Critical issues that demanded immediate attention._

### Trading Crisis - System Stuck for 7 Days

-

### CI Failure Due to Legacy SOFI Position

1. CI failed at 15:41 UTC with test `test_positions_are_spy_only` failing

**Key takeaway:** CLAUDE.

### System Blocked But No Auto-Cleanup Mechanism

The trading system correctly blocked new trades due to 30% risk exposure (3 spreads when max is 1), but there was NO automated mechanism to close excess positions. Result: **0 trades on Jan 20, 2026**

**Key takeaway:** If a system can detect a violation, it must also have an automated path to RESOLVE that violation.

## Important Discoveries

_Not emergencies, but insights that will shape how we trade going forward._

### SOFI PDT Crisis - SPY ONLY Violation

A SOFI short put position (SOFI260213P00032000) was opened at 14:35 UTC, violating the "SPY ONLY" directive in CLAUDE.md. The position is now -$150 unrealized and cannot be closed until tomorrow due t

### PDT Protection Blocks SOFI Position Close

SOFI260213P00032000 (short put) cannot be closed due to PDT (Pattern Day Trading) protection.

## Tech Stack Behind the Lessons

Every lesson we learn is captured, analyzed, and stored by our AI infrastructure:

### How We Learn Autonomously

| Component                 | Role in Learning                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Opus 4.5**       | Analyzes errors, extracts insights, determines severity |
| **Vertex AI RAG**         | Stores lessons with 768D embeddings for semantic search |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash**      | Retrieves relevant past lessons before new trades       |
| **OpenRouter (DeepSeek)** | Cost-effective sentiment analysis and research          |

### Why This Matters

1. **No Lesson Lost**: Every insight persists in our RAG corpus
2. **Contextual Recall**: Before each trade, we query similar past situations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: 200+ lessons shape every decision
4. **Transparent Journey**: All learnings published publicly

## The Journey So Far

We're building an autonomous AI trading system that learns from every mistake. This isn't about getting rich quick - it's about building a system that can consistently generate income through disciplined options trading.

**Our approach:**

- Paper trade for 90 days to validate the strategy
- Document every lesson, every failure, every win
- Use AI (Claude) as CTO to automate and improve
- Follow Phil Town's Rule #1: Don't lose money
