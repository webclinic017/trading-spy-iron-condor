questions:
  - question: "What is the Tetrate AI Buildathon?"
    answer: "A buildathon (collaborative hackathon) by Tetrate where participants add AI-powered features to new or existing apps using the Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS). Focuses on learning, building, and showcasing rather than intense competition."
  - question: "How does TARS help an AI trading system?"
    answer: "TARS provides a single gateway to route LLM calls across multiple providers with automatic fallback, per-token budgets, traffic splitting for A/B testing models, and centralized telemetry — all through an OpenAI-compatible API."

## The Buildathon

The [Tetrate AI Buildathon](https://tetrate.ai/buildathon/apply) challenges participants to build or enhance applications using [TARS (Tetrate Agent Router Service)](https://router.tetrate.ai) — an AI gateway that routes LLM calls across multiple providers.

We're bringing an existing system: an autonomous AI trading system that executes SPY iron condor options strategies with $100K in paper capital. The system already had multi-model routing built locally. TARS lets us move that routing to a centralized gateway with features we can't replicate locally.

## What We Already Had

Before the buildathon, our system included:

- **Budget-Aware Model Selection (BATS)** — routes tasks to the cheapest capable model ($25/month vs $500+)
- **5 LLM models** across 3 providers (DeepSeek, Mistral, Kimi K2, DeepSeek-R1, Claude Opus)
- **Feedback-driven context pipeline** — Thompson Sampling + LanceDB + MemAlign for continuous learning
- **84 GitHub Actions workflows** — self-healing CI that monitors, fixes, and learns autonomously
- **170+ documented lessons** — every failure recorded, indexed, and searchable via semantic search

## What TARS Adds

| Feature | Before (Local) | After (TARS) |
|---|---|---|
| **Fallback routing** | Code-level fallback chain in `model_selector.py` | Gateway-level auto-failover across providers |
| **Budget enforcement** | Local tracking, resets on restart | Server-side per-token budgets, persistent |
| **Traffic splitting** | Not possible | A/B test model quality (e.g., 90% Kimi K2 / 10% new model) |
| **Telemetry** | Manual logging | Centralized request logs, usage dashboards, cost tracking |
| **MCP profiles** | N/A | Curated tool subsets for different trading agents |
| **Key management** | Multiple env vars per provider | Single TARS key, BYOK for each provider behind the gateway |

The integration point is minimal — two environment variables:

```bash
LLM_GATEWAY_BASE_URL=https://api.router.tetrate.ai/v1
TETRATE_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

Every OpenAI-compatible call in the system routes through TARS with zero code changes.

## What We Built Today

In one buildathon day:

1. **README rewrite** — documented the real architecture with TARS integration for judges
2. **3 PaperBanana diagrams** — auto-generated publication-quality architecture visuals via Gemini
3. **2026 SOTA comparison** — researched how our feedback pipeline compares to Mem0, OpenAI Agents SDK, and state-of-the-art agent memory systems
4. **4 blog posts** — this one, plus deep-dives on [feedback pipelines](../feedback-driven-context-pipelines-2026/), [TARS routing](../tars-multi-model-routing-trading/), and [PaperBanana automation](../paperbanana-automated-architecture-diagrams/)
5. **3 Claude Code skills** — `/generate-diagram`, `/generate-plot`, `/update-diagrams` for repeatable diagram generation

## Key Insight

The biggest value of TARS isn't replacing what we already built — it's **centralizing** it. Our local `model_selector.py` does budget-aware routing well. But TARS adds the layer above: gateway-level failover, server-side budget persistence, traffic splitting for model evaluation, and a telemetry dashboard that works across all our agents without custom instrumentation.

For a trading system where reliability directly equals money, that centralization matters.
