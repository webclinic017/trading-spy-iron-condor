# Evaluation: LangGraph Production Features (Jan 21, 2026)

## Source

YouTube: "3 Hidden Features That Make AI Agents Production-Ready" - LangChain

## Verdict: PARTIALLY REDUNDANT

## Features Evaluated

1. Stream Reasoning Separately - REDUNDANT (we have GateResult.reason)
2. Session Continuity - REDUNDANT (we have PipelineCheckpointer)
3. Branching/Time Travel - NOT NEEDED for batch trading

## Why We Don't Need This

- Our trading system is batch execution, not interactive chat
- SQLite checkpointer already provides fault tolerance
- No browser UI to stream to

## What We Already Have

- checkpoint.py: Full SQLite checkpointing
- get_checkpoint_history(): Audit trail
- get_checkpoint_at_gate(): Resume from specific point
- Thread ID system for unique executions

## Decision

No action. Current implementation is sufficient.
