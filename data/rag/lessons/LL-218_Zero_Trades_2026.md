# LL-218: Zero Trades in 2026 - Trade Execution Gap

## Date: January 15, 2026

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Impact: $0 trades since Dec 30, 2025, 16+ days without trading

## What Happened

- Last recorded trade: December 30, 2025
- No trades executed in all of January 2026
- Workflows show "success" but 0 trades placed
- Paper account sitting at $4,959.18 with $9,918.36 buying power

## Evidence

```json
"trades": {
  "total_trades_today": 0,
  "last_trade_symbol": "none"
}
```

Trade archives:

- trades_2025-12-30.json (LAST TRADE)
- No 2026 trade files exist

## Root Cause Analysis (Investigation Needed)

1. Staleness guard (LL-217) was blocking - FIXED Jan 15
2. But trades STILL not executing after fix
3. Possible causes:
   - Execute Credit Spread exits early (no options found?)
   - Market conditions not met?
   - API key issues?
   - Another safety guard blocking?

## Next Steps

1. Run Execute Credit Spread manually with verbose logging
2. Check actual workflow logs for exit reason
3. Verify options contracts are available for SPY/IWM
4. Test API connectivity to Alpaca

## Impact on North Star Goal

- Lost 16 days of potential compounding
- At $50-70/trade target = $800-1,120 missed opportunity
- Sets back timeline by ~3 weeks
