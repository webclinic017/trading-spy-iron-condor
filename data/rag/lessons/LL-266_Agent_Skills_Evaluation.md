# LL-266: Agent Skills Specification Evaluation

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Category**: Resource Evaluation
**Verdict**: FLUFF

## Resource

- Anthropic Agent Skills Open Standard (December 2025)
- https://agentskills.io/specification

## What It Is

Agent Skills are organized folders with SKILL.md files containing metadata that AI agents can discover and load dynamically using "progressive disclosure." Complements MCP (tools) with procedural knowledge.

## Why FLUFF For Our System

1. **We have fixed capabilities** - Our 6-gate trading pipeline doesn't need dynamic skill discovery
2. **Already have similar infra** - `.claude/skills/` directory, `scripts/validate_skills.py`
3. **Wrong problem domain** - Agent Skills for general-purpose agents; we're purpose-built
4. **No profitability impact** - Doesn't affect trading logic or outcomes

## When Agent Skills WOULD Be Valuable

- Building general-purpose AI assistants
- Creating plugin ecosystems
- Cross-platform agent portability
- Dynamic capability discovery at runtime

## Our Current Architecture (Sufficient)

- `src/agents/base_agent.py` - LLM reasoning with memory
- `src/orchestrator/main.py` - 6-gate deterministic pipeline
- `.claude/skills/` - Simple skill structure for hooks/scripts

## Decision

No implementation needed. Current architecture is purpose-built and working.
