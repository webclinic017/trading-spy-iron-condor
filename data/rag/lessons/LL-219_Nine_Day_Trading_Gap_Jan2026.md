# LL-219: 9-Day Trading Gap (Jan 6-15, 2026)

## Date: January 15, 2026

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Impact: 9 days without any trades, missed $450-630 potential profit

## What Happened

- Last recorded trade: January 6, 2026 (SPY BUY @ $684.93)
- No trades January 7-15, 2026 (9 market days)
- Workflow logs show "success" but 0 trades placed
- Account sitting idle with $9,218 buying power unused

## Evidence

Dashboard shows:

- Date: 2026-01-06 | SPY | BUY | 0.73 shares | $684.93 | FILLED
- Total trades today (Jan 15): 0
- Win Rate: 0%

Account Status:

- Equity: $4,952.34
- Buying Power: $9,218.47
- Daily Change: -$6.84 (losing money from inactivity)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified

The `guaranteed_trader.py` had an overly restrictive Rule #1 check:

```python
# BROKEN: Blocked trades when ANY unrealized loss > $5
if total_unrealized_pnl < -5.0:
    return {"success": False, "reason": "rule_1_protection"}
```

### Fix Applied (Jan 15, 2026)

```python
# FIXED: Only block when losses exceed 2% of portfolio
loss_threshold = -account["equity"] * 0.02  # 2% = ~$100
if total_unrealized_pnl < loss_threshold:
    return {"success": False, "reason": "rule_1_protection"}
```

## Resolution

- Fixed threshold from -$5 to 2% of portfolio (~$100)
- After fix: 4 trades executed with +$2.08 gain
- Credit spread positions opened on SPY

## Prevention

1. Rule #1 should prevent BIG losses, not any red days
2. Threshold-based guards should be percentage-based, not fixed amounts
3. Add alerting when 0 trades for 2+ consecutive days

## Impact on North Star Goal

- Lost 9 days of potential compounding
- At $50-70/trade target = $450-630 missed opportunity
- Sets back timeline by ~2 weeks
