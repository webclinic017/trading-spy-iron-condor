| Lesson                        | Action                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| SOFI blackout violation       | SPY/IWM ONLY - no individual stocks |
| Naked puts = 96% risk         | Credit SPREADS only - defined risk  |
| Expiration past earnings      | Verify exp < any earnings date      |
| $100K account worked with SPY | Focus exclusively on SPY            |

## Pre-Market Checklist

- [ ] Check VIX level (target: <20 for credit spreads)
- [ ] Verify SPY not near major support/resistance
- [ ] Confirm account balance: ~$4,959
- [ ] Max position: 1 spread ($500 collateral = 10% risk)

## PRIMARY TRADE: SPY Bull Put Spread

**Why SPY:**

- Best liquidity (tightest bid/ask)
- No individual company earnings risk
- $100K account made +$16,661 on SPY focus
- LL-203 confirms this is the proven approach

**Setup:**
| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Underlying | SPY | Best liquidity per $100K lessons |
| Strategy | Bull Put Spread | Defined risk (Phil Town Rule #1) |
| Short strike | 30-delta (~$575-580) | 70% prob of profit |
| Long strike | $5 below short | Max loss capped |
| DTE | 30-45 days (Feb 14-21) | Theta decay sweet spot |
| Premium target | $0.60-0.80 ($60-80) | Realistic for VIX ~15 |
| Collateral | $500 | 10% of account |
| Max loss | $420-440 | Spread width - premium |

**Exit Rules:**
| Condition | Action | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| 50% profit ($30-40) | CLOSE | Bank gains, avoid reversal |
| 200% of premium loss | CLOSE | Cut losses per Rule #1 |
| 7 DTE | CLOSE | Gamma risk increases |
| VIX spikes >25 | CLOSE | Risk environment changed |

## BACKUP: IWM Bull Put Spread

Only if SPY spread is unavailable or has poor pricing.

| Parameter      | Value                |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Underlying     | IWM                  |
| Short strike   | 30-delta (~$215-220) |
| Long strike    | $5 below             |
| DTE            | 30-45 days           |
| Premium target | $0.50-0.70           |

| Ticker               | Reason                           | Until  |

## Risk Management

| Metric              | Value                | Status    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Max position size   | $500 (10% of $4,959) | ENFORCED  |
| Max daily loss      | $250 (5% of account) | ENFORCED  |
| Earnings check      | trade_gateway.py     | AUTOMATED |
| Phil Town alignment | Defined risk spread  | COMPLIANT |

## Expected Outcome

| Scenario                     | Probability | P/L       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| SPY stays above short strike | 70%         | +$60-80   |
| SPY drops, close at 50% loss | 20%         | -$30-40   |
| SPY drops hard, max loss     | 10%         | -$420-440 |

**Expected Value:** (0.70 × $70) + (0.20 × -$35) + (0.10 × -$430) = $49 - $7 - $43 = **-$1**

This is a NEUTRAL expected value trade - we need 70%+ win rate to profit. Focus on:

1. Proper strike selection (30-delta, not ATM)
2. Early profit taking (50% rule)
3. Strict stop loss adherence

## Post-Trade Protocol

- [ ] If loss: record lesson in LL-206
- [ ] If win: document what worked
