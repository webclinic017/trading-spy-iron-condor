## Architecture

### LLM Gateway & TARS Integration

![LLM Gateway Architecture](docs/assets/llm_gateway_architecture.png)
*Multi-model routing via TARS with budget-aware fallback to OpenRouter and Anthropic Direct*

The system routes all LLM calls through a unified gateway (`src/utils/llm_gateway.py`) that supports [Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS)](https://router.tetrate.ai) as the primary provider, with OpenRouter and direct Anthropic as fallbacks.

| Env Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LLM_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | TARS endpoint (e.g. `https://api.router.tetrate.ai/v1`) |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY` / `TETRATE_API_KEY` | TARS authentication |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter fallback for cost-optimized models |

**Budget-Aware Model Selection** (`src/utils/model_selector.py`) implements the BATS framework — routing tasks to the cheapest model that can handle the complexity:

| Task Complexity | Model | Cost (per 1M tokens) | Provider |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple (parsing, classification) | DeepSeek V3 | $0.30 / $1.20 | TARS or OpenRouter |
| Medium (analysis, signals) | Mistral Medium 3 | $0.40 / $2.00 | TARS or OpenRouter |
| Complex (risk, strategy) | Kimi K2 | $0.39 / $1.90 | TARS or OpenRouter |
| Reasoning (pre-trade research) | DeepSeek-R1 | $0.70 / $2.50 | TARS or OpenRouter |
| Critical (trade execution) | Claude Opus | $15 / $75 | Anthropic Direct |

Safety guarantee: trade execution **always** uses Opus regardless of budget. Fallback chain: Opus -> Kimi K2 -> Mistral -> DeepSeek.

### Feedback-Driven Context Pipeline

![Feedback Pipeline](docs/assets/feedback_pipeline.png)
*Continuous learning: Signal Capture -> Thompson Sampling -> Memory Storage -> Context Injection*

- **LanceDB vector store** — Semantic search over 170+ lessons learned (`rag_knowledge/lessons_learned/`)
- **Thompson Sampling** — Beta-Bernoulli model per task category with 30-day exponential decay
- **MemAlign** — Distills feedback into principles; syncs to ShieldCortex persistent memory
- **Context injection** — Weak categories and past failures injected into every session start

### Trading Pipeline

![Trading Pipeline](docs/assets/trading_pipeline.png)
*6-stage execution with safety gates at every step and a closed learning loop*

### Ralph Mode (Autonomous CI)

Ralph is the self-healing loop that keeps the system operational:

- **84 GitHub Actions workflows** — trading execution, position management, monitoring, learning
- **Self-Healing Monitor** — runs every 15 minutes during market hours, auto-fixes issues
- **Ralph Loop** — overnight autonomous coding sessions (design-first, atomic tasks, validation gates)
- **Auto-published blog** — lessons and reports publish to GitHub Pages and Dev.to automatically

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM Gateway** | TARS/OpenRouter/Anthropic routing | `src/utils/llm_gateway.py` |
| **Model Selector** | Budget-aware BATS framework | `src/utils/model_selector.py` |
| **Orchestrator** | Main trading logic | `src/orchestrator/main.py` |
| **Thompson Sampler** | Strategy selection | `src/ml/trade_confidence.py` |
| **Trade Memory** | SQLite trade journal | `src/learning/trade_memory.py` |
| **Risk Manager** | Position sizing, stops | `src/risk/` |
| **RAG Index** | LanceDB semantic search | `scripts/build_rag_query_index.py` |
| **RLHF Pipeline** | Feedback capture + learning | `.claude/rules/rlhf-feedback.md` |
| **Autonomous Trader** | End-to-end execution | `scripts/autonomous_trader.py` |

## Strategy: SPY Iron Condors

```
Sell 15-20 delta put spread + 15-20 delta call spread
$5-wide wings, 30-45 DTE
Exit: 50% profit OR 7 DTE | Stop: 200% of credit
Max risk: $5,000 per position (5% of $100K)
```

**Why iron condors**: Defined risk on both sides, ~85% probability of profit at 15-delta, theta decay works daily, profits in sideways markets. Phil Town Rule #1 (don't lose money) enforced at every level.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/trading.git
cd trading
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure API keys (see .env.example for full list)
```

```bash
python3 scripts/autonomous_trader.py     # Paper trading
python3 scripts/sync_alpaca_state.py     # Sync broker state
python3 scripts/system_health_check.py   # Health check
pytest tests/ -q                         # Run tests
ruff check src/                          # Lint
```

## Risk Management

| Safeguard | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Position Limits** | Max 5% per position ($5,000) |
| **Stop-Loss** | 200% of credit received, no exceptions |
| **Exit** | 50% profit OR 7 DTE, whichever first |
| **Max Positions** | 2 iron condors at a time (Phase 1) |
| **Paper First** | 90-day validation before live capital |
