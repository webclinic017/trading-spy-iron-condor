### Key Insight from Euan Sinclair (Positional Options Trading)

> "I am going to give a list of edges. An edge isn't a 'setup' or 'system.'"

Chapter 5 lists persistent trading edges that have worked over years — this is particularly relevant for systematic trading systems.

## Part 3: Documented Profitable Strategies

### 3.1 The Wheel Strategy

**What It Is:**
Systematic cycle of selling cash-secured puts → getting assigned → selling covered calls → getting called away → repeat

**Documented Returns:**
| Source | Return | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Reddit r/thetagang survey | 15-40% annually | Self-reported, varies widely |
| OptionsTradingIQ case study | 7-10% per trade | Real examples with GE, EWZ, BHP |
| Medium backtest (SPY) | ~7-10% annually | Consistent across bull/bear markets |
| Brokereviews estimate | ~28% average | Aggregate estimate |

**Best Conditions:**

- Low-to-moderate volatility environments
- Stable, dividend-paying stocks or major ETFs
- Capital requirement: ~$5,000-10,000 minimum for meaningful positions

**Key Stocks/ETFs for Wheel:**

- SPY, QQQ, IWM (index ETFs — most liquid options)
- Blue chips: KO, PG, MSFT, AAPL
- Dividend aristocrats for downside comfort

### 3.2 Iron Condor

**What It Is:**
Sell OTM put spread + sell OTM call spread simultaneously

**Why It Works:**

- Defined max profit and loss
- Profits from time decay in range-bound markets
- Lower capital requirement than wheel

**Target Returns:** 2-4% monthly in ideal conditions

### 3.3 Credit Spreads (Bull Put / Bear Call)

**What It Is:**

- Bull Put Spread: Sell put, buy lower strike put
- Bear Call Spread: Sell call, buy higher strike call

**Why Relevant for Small Accounts:**

- Defined risk
- Lower capital requirements than cash-secured positions
- Can be traded with accounts under $5,000

### 3.4 Covered Calls / Buy-Write

**Academic Performance (OIC Research):**

- 15-year study on Russell 2000
- 2% OTM buy-write: 8.87% annually vs. 8.11% index
- Lower volatility (16.57% vs. 21% for index)

## Part 4: Small Account Strategies ($500-$5,000)

### Challenges

- Pattern Day Trader rule ($25K minimum for 4+ day trades/week)
- Limited margin access
- Position sizing constraints
- Higher relative impact of commissions/fees

### Recommended Approaches

**1. Vertical Spreads (Credit/Debit)**

- Defined risk
- Lower capital per trade
- Can start with $500-1,000

**2. Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC)**

- Buy deep ITM LEAPS as stock substitute
- Sell short-term calls against it
- Requires less capital than traditional covered calls

**3. Cash-Secured Puts on Low-Priced Stocks**

- Target stocks trading $5-20
- Premium collection with defined capital
- Build toward wheel strategy

**4. Single-Leg Options with Strict Risk Management**

- Risk only 1-2% of account per trade
- Focus on high-probability setups
- Requires patience and selectivity

### Realistic Expectations

| Account Size | Realistic Monthly Target | Annual Target |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| $500         | $25-50 (5-10%)           | 60-120%       |
| $1,000       | $50-100 (5-10%)          | 60-120%       |
| $5,000       | $150-400 (3-8%)          | 36-96%        |
| $10,000+     | $200-600 (2-6%)          | 24-72%        |

Note: Higher percentage returns are possible with smaller accounts but come with proportionally higher risk and require exceptional discipline.

## Part 6: Critical Insights for Your System

### What the Research Actually Says

1. **Short volatility strategies outperform** — but require proper risk management
2. **Simple beats complex** — OLS regression beat neural networks in volatility prediction
3. **Consistency over home runs** — Wheel/income strategies show steady 7-28% annually
4. **Most retail traders lose** — Simple directional strategies have negative expected value
5. **Edge persistence** — Some edges persist for years (see Sinclair's book)

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Strategies promising 100%+ annual returns with "low risk"
- Anything requiring perfect market timing
- Overleveraged positions
- Trading without defined exit criteria

### What Your System Should Prioritize

1. **Volatility harvesting** (selling premium when IV > realized volatility)
2. **Defined risk** on every trade
3. **Position sizing** based on account equity
4. **Systematic entry/exit** rules with no discretion
5. **Trade logging** for continuous improvement

---

## Part 7: Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Read Sinclair's "Positional Options Trading" Chapter 5 for exploitable edges
2. Backtest wheel strategy on your target ETFs
3. Review OIC research on buy-write performance

### For Your RAG Database

Ingest and index:

- This document
- Natenberg's volatility chapters
- OIC research PDFs
- TastyTrade backtests on defined-risk strategies

### For System Development

- Implement IV percentile screening
- Build position sizing based on account equity and max risk per trade
- Create systematic entry rules based on volatility regime

## Part 8: Strategy Validation Against Current System

### Current Strategy (from CLAUDE.md)

- Credit spreads on SPY/IWM only
- 30-delta put spreads (70% probability of profit)
- $150-250/month target (3-5% monthly)
- 30-45 DTE, close at 50% max profit
- Max 5% risk per trade ($248)

### Research Validation

| Strategy Element    | Research Support                               | Confidence |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Credit spreads      | Supported by SMU paper (short vol outperforms) | HIGH       |
| SPY/IWM focus       | Best liquidity, tightest spreads (UCLA paper)  | HIGH       |
| 30-delta (70% PoP)  | Aligns with Phil Town margin of safety         | MEDIUM     |
| 3-5% monthly target | Within documented range for $5K accounts       | HIGH       |
| 30-45 DTE           | Optimal theta decay per OIC research           | HIGH       |
| 50% profit target   | TastyTrade research supports early exit        | HIGH       |

### Gaps Identified

1. **IV Percentile Check**: Not currently implemented - should sell premium when IV > 30th percentile
2. **Realized vs Implied Vol**: No comparison - key edge per Aldridge paper
3. **VIX Regime Filter**: Consider pausing during VIX > 30 periods
