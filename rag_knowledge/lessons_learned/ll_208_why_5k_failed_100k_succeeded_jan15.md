# LL-208: Why $5K Failed While $100K Succeeded

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Category**: Strategy, Post-Mortem
**Severity**: CRITICAL

## The Question

CEO asked: "Why aren't we making money in our $5K paper trading account even though we made a lot of money and had good success in the $100K paper trading account?"

## The Evidence

**$100K Account (Jan 7):**

- +$16,661.20 profit (+16.45% in ONE DAY)
- Sold puts on SPY and AMD
- Used iron condors (defined risk)
- Concentrated SPY focus after consolidation

**$5K Account (Jan 14):**

- -$40.74 loss (-0.81%)
- Traded SOFI (not SPY)
- Used naked CSP (not spreads)
- 96% position size
- Traded into earnings

## The Four Violations

| Rule     | $100K Account | $5K Account       |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Ticker   | SPY/AMD       | SOFI ❌           |
| Strategy | Iron condors  | Naked puts ❌     |
| Size     | Proportional  | 96% ❌            |
| Earnings | Avoided       | Traded through ❌ |

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Ignored proven data**: The $100K account showed SPY premium selling works
2. **Changed what was working**: Switched to SOFI without reason
3. **Increased risk**: Naked puts instead of defined-risk spreads
4. **Position sizing failure**: 96% is gambling, not trading
5. **Earnings trap**: Never trade options through earnings

## The RAG Failure

The biggest failure was NOT recording lessons from the $100K account:

- Zero lessons recorded during profitable period
- No trade data preserved
- No win/loss analysis captured
- Same mistakes were repeated

## Corrective Actions

1. **SPY/IWM only** - No individual stocks until proven
2. **Credit spreads only** - No naked positions
3. **5% max position size** - $248 max risk per trade
4. **No earnings trades** - Check calendar before every trade
5. **Record every trade** - To RAG within 24 hours

## The Lesson

We had the answer all along. The $100K account proved SPY premium selling works.
We just didnt follow our own success.

**Stop ignoring what works. Replicate success.**
