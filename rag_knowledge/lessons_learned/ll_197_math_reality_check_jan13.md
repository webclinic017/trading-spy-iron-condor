# LL-197: Critical Math Reality Check - Credit Spread Risk/Reward

## Critical Finding

**Credit spreads have a 4:1 risk/reward ratio that requires 80%+ win rate to break even.**

## The Math

### Raw Risk/Reward (Hold to Expiration)

- Premium collected: $100
- Max loss (collateral): $500
- Risk: $400 to make $100
- Break-even win rate: **80%**

### With Take Profit (50%) & Stop Loss (100%)

- Take profit: +$50
- Stop loss: -$100
- Risk/Reward: 2:1
- Break-even win rate: **67%**

### Expected Value by Win Rate (10 spreads)

| Win Rate | EV/Spread | Daily (10 spreads) |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| 50%      | -$25      | -$50/day           |
| 60%      | -$10      | -$20/day           |
| 70%      | +$5       | +$10/day           |
| 80%      | +$20      | +$40/day           |

## North Star Reality

**$100/day REQUIRES:**

- $12,500+ capital (not $5,000)
- 80%+ win rate sustained
- 25 spreads/week (not 10)

**With current $5K:**

- Max realistic daily income: ~$40/day (at 80% win rate)
- This is NOT $100/day

## Timeline to North Star

| Month | Capital | Potential Daily   |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Now   | $5,000  | $40/day max       |
| 6     | $8,500  | $68/day max       |
| 11    | $13,300 | $100/day possible |

## Action Items

1. **Recalibrate expectations**: $40/day is realistic target now
2. **Track win rate obsessively**: Need 80%+ to be profitable
3. **Do NOT increase position size** until win rate proven
4. **Compound slowly**: 11 months to $100/day is honest

## CEO Acknowledgment Required

The math does not support $100/day with $5K capital.
We can reach $100/day, but it requires:

- 11+ months of disciplined trading
- 80%+ win rate
- Continuous deposits
- Zero major losses (Rule #1)
