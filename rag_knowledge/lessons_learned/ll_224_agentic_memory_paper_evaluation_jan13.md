# LL-224: Resource Evaluation: Agentic Memory Paper

**ID:** LL-185
**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** resource-evaluation

## Resource

- **Title:** Agentic Memory: Learning Unified Long-Term and Short-Term Memory Management for Large Language Model Agents
- **Source:** arXiv:2601.01885 (January 2026)
- **Authors:** Alibaba Group and Wuhan University

## Verdict: FLUFF

This paper is valid academic research but not applicable to our trading system.

## Why Not Applicable

1. **Benchmark mismatch:** Paper optimizes for game environments (ALFWorld, SciWorld, PDDL, BabyAI, HotpotQA), not financial trading
2. **We don't have context overflow:** Trading decisions are one-shot queries, not 100-turn game sessions
3. **Implementation cost prohibitive:** Requires RL training infrastructure, Qwen model fine-tuning
4. **We already have LTM:** legacy RAG with text-embedding-004 handles our needs

## What We Have

- `src/rag/cloud_rag.py` - Semantic search with 768-dim embeddings
- `src/rag/lessons_learned_rag.py` - Keyword-based backup search
- No STM needed for our use case

## Optional Future Enhancement

Consider adding `update_lesson()` and `delete_lesson()` to cloud_rag.py for better memory hygiene, but this doesn't require the full AgeMem framework.
