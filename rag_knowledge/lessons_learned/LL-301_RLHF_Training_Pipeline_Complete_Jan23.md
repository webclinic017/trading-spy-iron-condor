# LL-301: RLHF Feedback Training Pipeline Completion

**ID**: LL-301
**Date**: 2026-01-23
**Severity**: IMPROVEMENT
**Category**: ML Infrastructure
**Status**: COMPLETED

## What Was Missing

The RLHF feedback capture pipeline was incomplete:

- `capture_feedback.sh` hook detected thumbs up/down
- Hook called `scripts/train_from_feedback.py` which DID NOT EXIST
- Feedback model `models/ml/feedback_model.json` existed but wasn't being updated

## The Fix

Created `scripts/train_from_feedback.py` with:

1. **Thompson Sampling** (Beta-Bernoulli conjugate prior)
   - Positive feedback: α += 1
   - Negative feedback: β += 1
   - Posterior = α / (α + β)

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extracts keywords from context (test, ci, trade, rag, pr, etc.)
   - Updates feature_weights with ±0.1 per feedback

3. **Full Test Coverage**
   - 10 tests in `tests/test_train_from_feedback.py`

## ML Pipeline Now Complete

```
User feedback (thumbs up/down)
    ↓
capture_feedback.sh (hook)
    ↓
train_from_feedback.py
    ↓
feedback_model.json (α/β, feature_weights)
    ↓
surface_feedback_patterns.sh (session start display)
```

## Current Model State

- α=4.0, β=1.0 (Posterior: 0.80)
- Positive patterns: test(+0.20), ci(+0.10), entry(+0.10)
- 114 thumbs up, 77 thumbs down (59.69% satisfaction)

## Future Improvement

Consider integrating feedback model into trade gate:

- Query feedback model before trades
- Adjust confidence based on feature weights
- Warn when patterns match negative features
