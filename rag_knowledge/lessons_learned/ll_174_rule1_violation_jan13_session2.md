# LL-174: Repeated Rule #1 Violation - Still Holding Losing Positions

**ID**: ll_174
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Type**: Risk Management Failure

## Problem

Despite having 26 lessons in RAG about Rule #1 (Don't Lose Money), the system:

1. Held losing short put positions (-$7 unrealized)
2. Had VIOLATION status recorded but no automatic closure
3. Required manual intervention to trigger emergency protection

## Evidence

From `data/system_state.json`:

```json
"risk": {
  "VIOLATION": "System added to losing positions without stop-loss",
  "action_required": "Set stop-loss on puts immediately",
  "status": "MONITORED - Short puts have -$7 unrealized loss"
}
```

Total P/L: -$30.06 (-0.6%)
Daily Change: -$17.94

## Root Cause

1. RAG lessons exist but aren't enforced in code
2. No automatic stop-loss implementation
3. Trade gateway allows new positions even with violations
4. Self-healing doesn't auto-close losing positions

## Solution Applied

1. Triggered emergency-protection.yml workflow
2. Set max_loss_pct to 10% for immediate protection
3. Recording this lesson for future prevention

## Prevention Required

1. **MUST IMPLEMENT**: Automatic stop-loss in trade_gateway.py
2. **MUST IMPLEMENT**: Block new trades when VIOLATION status exists
3. **MUST IMPLEMENT**: Daily P/L check before market open
4. **MUST IMPLEMENT**: Auto-close positions losing >5%

## CEO Directive

"Don't lose money" - Phil Town Rule #1. This is non-negotiable.
