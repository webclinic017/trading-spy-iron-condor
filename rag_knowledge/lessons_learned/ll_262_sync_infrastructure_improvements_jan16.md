# LL-262: Data Sync Infrastructure Improvements

## Date: January 16, 2026

## Severity: IMPROVEMENT

## Impact: Better operational integrity, faster data freshness

## Problem Statement

CEO observed that data was frequently out of sync during market hours, causing:

- Confusion between live Alpaca data and local system_state.json
- Feature branch isolation from main branch syncs
- No proactive validation of data integrity

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Sync frequency too low**: 30-min sync interval matched staleness threshold exactly
2. **No data validation**: Could have corrupted data without detection
3. **No sync health tracking**: Couldn't diagnose sync issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Sync Frequency (PR #2029)

- Peak hours (10am-3pm ET): Every 15 minutes
- Market open/close: Every 30 minutes
- Added manual trigger option with force_sync parameter

### 2. Data Integrity Validation

Added to `src/utils/staleness_guard.py`:

- `DataIntegrityResult` dataclass
- `validate_system_state()` - validates required fields, positive equity/cash
- `check_data_integrity()` - helper for health checks
- Warns on position count mismatch or large equity drift (>20%)

### 3. Sync Health Tracking

Added to sync workflow:

```json
"sync_health": {
  "last_successful_sync": "timestamp",
  "sync_source": "github_actions",
  "sync_count_today": 15,
  "history": [/* last 24 syncs */]
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Staleness Guard

- Shows sync health summary in output
- 30-min threshold during market hours (vs 4h after hours)

## Key Learnings

1. **Sync frequency should be 2x faster than staleness threshold** to avoid edge cases
2. **Data validation catches issues before they cause problems**
3. **Sync history enables debugging of sync failures**

## Metrics After Implementation

- Max staleness during market hours: 15 min (was 30 min)
- Data integrity check: Passes on every health check
- Sync health visibility: Full history available
