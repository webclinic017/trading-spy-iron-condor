# LL-211: $100K Trade History Analysis Workflow

**ID**: LL-211
**Date**: January 15, 2026
**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Data Recovery / Workflow

## Problem

During the $100K paper trading period (November-December 2025), lessons were recorded in legacy RAG but NOT synced to local files or the blog. This created a visibility gap.

## Solution Created

A GitHub Actions workflow was created on January 14, 2026 to fetch and analyze all historical trades from the $100K paper account.

### Workflow Location

`.github/workflows/analyze-100k-history.yml`

### How to Trigger

The workflow is manual-dispatch only. Trigger it by:

1. Go to: https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/trading/actions
2. Find "Analyze $100K Trade History" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select `main` branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

### What It Does

1. Fetches all filled orders from the past 90 days
2. Groups by symbol and underlying
3. Calculates net premium collected/spent
4. Creates `data/100k_trade_history_analysis.json` with full data
5. Creates/updates a lesson file with findings
6. Auto-creates PR and merges to main

### Credentials Used

- `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADING_API_KEY` (the old $100K paper account)
- `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADING_API_SECRET`

## Why This Matters

The $100K account contained profitable trades we never learned from. This workflow extracts that institutional knowledge and applies it to the $5K account strategy.

## Action Items

- [ ] Trigger workflow to fetch actual trade history
- [ ] Review generated analysis
- [ ] Apply learnings to current strategy
- [ ] Sync lessons to blog
