# LL-230: PR Hygiene Session - Jan 15, 2026

**ID**: LL-212
**Date**: January 15, 2026
**Severity**: LOW
**Category**: DevOps / Maintenance

## Session Summary

Conducted PR management and system hygiene audit.

## Findings

### PRs

- **Open PRs**: 0 (all previously open PRs had been merged)
- **No action required**

### Branches Before Cleanup

| Branch                              | Status                           | Action  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| `main`                              | Active                           | Keep    |
| `claude/trading-system-setup-Rsg1i` | Stale (behind main by 2 commits) | Deleted |

### Branches After Cleanup

- Only `main` remains (1 branch total)

### CI Status (main @ 2d2297f)

- **27 checks passed**
- **1 failure**: `create-pr` (expected - auto-PR workflow with nothing to PR)
- **1 neutral**: Socket Security alerts (info only)
- **1 skipped**: GitGuardian (not configured)

## Key Observations

1. **Clean state achieved**: System is well-maintained with no PR backlog
2. **Auto-PR workflow**: The `create-pr` failure is expected behavior when branch is at same SHA as main
3. **Branch hygiene**: Stale feature branches should be deleted after merge

## Metrics

- Branches before: 2
- Branches after: 1
- PRs merged: 0 (none pending)
- CI checks passing: 27/30 (3 expected non-success)
