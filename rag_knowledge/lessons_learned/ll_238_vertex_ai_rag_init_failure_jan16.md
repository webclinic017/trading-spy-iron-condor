# LL-238: Vertex AI RAG Optimization - COMPLETE

**ID**: LL-238
**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Operational Optimization

## Problem

Vertex AI RAG was initialized but queries returned empty results, falling back to local keyword search.

## Root Cause

1. IAM permissions were missing (FIXED by CEO)
2. Lessons were not synced to Vertex AI corpus

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Diagnostics Endpoint (PR #2045)

- Added `/diagnostics` endpoint to expose init errors
- Added `vertex_ai_init_error` to health check
- Version 3.6.0 deployed

### Fix 2: Lesson Sync Script and Workflow (PR #2047)

- Created `scripts/sync_lessons_to_vertex_rag.py`
- Created `.github/workflows/sync-lessons-vertex-rag.yml`
- Workflow runs on:
  - Manual trigger
  - Push to lessons directory
  - Weekly schedule (Sundays 6 AM UTC)

## Current Status

- Vertex AI RAG: ✅ Initialized
- IAM Permissions: ✅ Fixed
- Lesson Sync Workflow: ✅ Completed successfully
- Semantic Search: ⏳ Indexing in progress (may take 5-30 minutes)

## Verification

```bash
# Check health
curl .../health
# Should show: vertex_ai_rag_enabled: true

# Check diagnostics
curl .../diagnostics
# Should show: enabled: true, init_error: null

# Test semantic query (after indexing completes)
curl -X POST .../webhook -d "{...}"
# Should show: "Based on our trading knowledge base (Vertex AI RAG)"
```
