# LL-273: CTO Failure - Stale Data Led to Misinformation

**ID**: LL-273
**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Operational Failure

## What Happened

CTO (Claude) gave CEO incorrect P/L information multiple times:

- Claimed $0.00 profit when actual was **-$70.13 loss**
- Used stale local data instead of live Alpaca data
- Failed to verify claims before making them

## Root Cause

1. Local `system_state.json` was hours out of date
2. CTO relied on cached data instead of triggering fresh sync FIRST
3. Violated Chain-of-Verification protocol

## Actual Results (Jan 21, 2026)

| Metric    | Value                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Portfolio | $5,028.84                    |
| Daily P/L | **-$70.13**                  |
| Cause     | SOFI position closed at loss |

## CTO Failures

1. ❌ Gave wrong P/L numbers multiple times
2. ❌ Told CEO to check Alpaca manually (violates "never tell CEO to do manual work")
3. ❌ Did not verify data freshness before making claims
4. ❌ Made excuses instead of fixing the problem

## Prevention

1. ALWAYS trigger sync-system-state.yml BEFORE reporting any numbers
2. NEVER report P/L without fresh data (< 5 min old)
3. Add data freshness check to all reporting scripts
4. When uncertain, say "data may be stale, syncing now..."

## Lesson

Trust but verify. Local cache is not source of truth. Alpaca API is source of truth.
