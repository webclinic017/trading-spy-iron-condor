# LL-253: Rule #1 Compliance Check - Jan 16, 2026

**ID**: LL-253
**Date**: January 16, 2026
**Category**: Risk Management / Rule #1
**Severity**: HIGH

## Context

CEO reminded: "We are not allowed to lose money!!!"

Current portfolio status:

- Equity: $4,985.72
- Total P/L: -$14.28 (-0.29%)
- Unrealized P/L: +$26.68

## Position Analysis

**Credit Spreads (Proper):**
| Spread | Width | P/L |
|--------|-------|-----|
| $565/$570 | $5 | -$1 |
| $595/$600 | $5 | -$3 |
| $653/$658 | $5 | -$3 |

**Orphan Position (LL-221):**

- Long $660 Put: +$35 P/L (currently profitable but decaying)

## Rule #1 Compliance

✅ **WITHIN LIMITS**

- Current loss: $14.28
- Max allowed (5%): $250.00
- Buffer remaining: $235.72
- Loss is only 5.7% of max allowed

## Key Insights

1. **Small losses are acceptable** if within defined risk limits
2. **Orphan position** from LL-221 is actually helping (+$35)
3. **Credit spreads** have negative theta working FOR us (time decay)
4. **35 DTE remaining** - no panic needed

## Action Items

1. Monitor positions through weekend
2. Consider closing $660 orphan put while profitable
3. Close credit spreads at 50% profit target
4. Set stop-loss at 2x credit received

## Prevention

- Always check position balance (longs = shorts)
- Review P/L daily during Ralph Mode
- Alert on Rule #1 violations (>5% drawdown)
