# LL-268: Iron Condor Win Rate Improvement Research

**Date**: January 21, 2026
**Category**: Strategy / Research
**Severity**: HIGH
**Source**: Web research on iron condor optimization

## Problem

Current win rate is 33.3% (2/6 trades) vs target 80%+. Need to improve.

## Research Findings

### Delta Selection (Optimal: 10-25 delta)

- 15-delta shorts = ~70% win rate
- 20-25 delta shorts = 75-80% win rate with meaningful premium
- 30-delta shorts = only 34% win rate (too aggressive)
- Our current: 15-20 delta (correct range)

### Profit Taking (CRITICAL for 80%+ win rate)

- **Close at 50% profit**: Boosts win rate from ~60% to 80-85%
- Capture 50% profit in ~40% of the time
- Don't hold to expiration

### Time Exit (Improve from 21 DTE to 7 DTE)

- Close at 7 DTE if not at profit target
- Risk no longer worth reward after 7 DTE
- Our current: 21 DTE (consider reducing to 7 DTE)

### 0DTE Iron Condors (Alternative Strategy)

- 82.7% win rate in backtests (100/133 trades)
- Requires 5-15 delta with tight stop-losses
- Day trading approach - higher frequency

## Recommended Changes

| Parameter     | Current | Recommended        |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Short delta   | 15-20   | 15-20 (keep)       |
| Profit target | 50%     | 50% (keep)         |
| Time exit     | 21 DTE  | **7 DTE** (change) |
| DTE at entry  | 30-45   | 30-45 (keep)       |
| Stop-loss     | 200%    | 200% (keep)        |

## Key Insight

The 33.3% win rate suggests trades are being held too long OR entered at wrong delta. The 50% profit target and 7 DTE exit are CRITICAL for achieving 80%+ win rate.

## Action Items

1. Update time exit from 21 DTE to 7 DTE
2. Ensure 50% profit target is strictly enforced
3. Verify delta selection at entry (15-20 delta)
