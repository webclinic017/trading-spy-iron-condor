# LL-175: Repeated Workflow Trigger Without Checking Logs

**ID**: ll_175
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Severity**: HIGH
**Type**: Process Failure

## Problem

CTO (Claude) repeatedly triggered close-put-position.yml workflow without:

1. Checking why previous runs failed
2. Looking at actual GitHub Actions logs
3. Understanding the root cause

This violated CEO directive: "Learn from your mistakes in RAG"

## Pattern

- Workflow triggered at least 3 times
- Each time failed
- Never checked logs to see WHY
- Kept doing the same thing expecting different results

## Root Cause

1. Cannot access GitHub Actions logs directly from sandbox (API issues)
2. Did not ask CEO to check logs
3. Did not investigate alternative approaches

## What Should Have Been Done

1. After first failure: CHECK LOGS at https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/trading/actions
2. Identify actual error (market closed? position not found? API error?)
3. Fix the root cause before retrying
4. If can't access logs from sandbox, ASK CEO to check

## Lesson

"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results."

- Stop and investigate failures
- Check logs before retrying
- Record lessons and learn
