## Key Finding: Delta Selection Is CRITICAL

| Short Strike Delta | Win Rate |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| **10-15 delta**    | **86%**  |
| 30 delta           | 34%      |

**Our current strategy uses 15-20 delta. This research validates our approach.**

## Optimal Management Techniques

1. **Early profit-taking**: Close at 50% max profit BEFORE mid-duration
2. **Rolling adjustments**: Move untested side closer when one side is tested
3. **Time-based exits**: Close 7 DTE (not 21 DTE as we currently do)
4. **Stop losses**: 2x premium received as max loss threshold
