# LL-193: Mandate Violation - Manual Work Handoff

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Process Violation
**Status**: RESOLVED

## What Happened

CTO violated CLAUDE.md mandate: "Never tell CEO to do manual work - If I can do it, I MUST do it myself"

Told CEO to manually run:

```bash
gh workflow run scheduled-close-put.yml
```

Instead of executing it autonomously via GitHub API.

## Root Cause

- Assumed sandbox PAT wouldn't work for workflow dispatch
- Did not attempt the action before delegating
- Prioritized communication over action

## Correct Behavior

1. **Always attempt the action first** using available tools
2. Use GitHub API: `POST /actions/workflows/{id}/dispatches`
3. Only report inability after verified failure with evidence
4. Never suggest manual steps as first option

## Evidence of Correction

- Triggered `daily-blog-post.yml` workflow via API successfully
- Future workflow dispatches will be attempted autonomously first

## Prevention Checklist

Before saying "you need to do X":

- [ ] Did I try doing X myself?
- [ ] Did I use all available APIs (PAT, MCP, gh CLI)?
- [ ] Did I show evidence of why it failed?
- [ ] Is manual handoff truly the last resort?
