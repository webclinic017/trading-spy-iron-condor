# LL-252: SOFI Ticker Blackout Violation

**ID**: LL-252
**Date**: January 14, 2026
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: Configuration / Risk Management

## What Happened

Trading workflow was configured to execute credit spreads and CSPs on SOFI, despite CLAUDE.md explicitly stating SOFI was on blackout until Feb 1 (earnings Jan 30, IV 55%).

This caused:

1. Workflow failures when SOFI options couldn't be found or executed
2. Zero trades executing despite workflow "success"
3. $40.74 realized loss from emergency SOFI position closure

## Root Cause

Hardcoded ticker lists in `.github/workflows/daily-trading.yml`:

- Line 1033: `TICKERS="SOFI F BAC"` (credit spreads)
- Line 1053: `for TICKER in SOFI PLTR F BAC AMD SPY` (CSPs)
- Line 202: `--symbol SPY --symbol SOFI --symbol AMD --symbol PLTR` (RAG query)
- `execute_credit_spread.py` default: `--symbol default="SOFI"`

## Resolution

PR #1796 removed SOFI from all ticker lists:

- Credit spreads: `SPY IWM F`
- CSPs: `SPY IWM F T PLTR AMD`
- RAG query: `SPY IWM AMD PLTR`
- Default symbol: `SPY`

## Prevention

1. **ALWAYS cross-reference CLAUDE.md ticker hierarchy before adding tickers**
2. **Use dynamic blackout checking** - read from CLAUDE.md or config, not hardcoded
3. **Add pre-trade validation** - check if ticker is in blackout period
4. **CI check** - validate workflow ticker lists against CLAUDE.md

## Phil Town Rule #1 Impact

Earnings blackout exists to prevent losses from high-IV events. Violating blackout = violating Rule #1.
