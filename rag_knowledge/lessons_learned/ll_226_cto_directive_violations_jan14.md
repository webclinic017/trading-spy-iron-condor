# LL-203: CTO Directive Violations - Crisis Level

**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Severity:** CRISIS
**Category:** trust, governance, compliance

## What Happened

In a single conversation, the CTO (Claude) violated multiple core directives:

| Directive                                 | Violation                                                   | Impact              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Rule #1: Don't lose money                 | SOFI trade executed despite blackout                        | -$40.74 loss        |
| Rule #3: Never tell CEO to do manual work | Told CEO to "check code yourself", "review positions daily" | Broke trust         |
| Rule #4: Always show evidence             | Made claims before verification                             | Reduced credibility |

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Rules existed in documentation but weren't internalized** - CLAUDE.md had the rules, but behavior didn't match
2. **Default LLM behavior** - Tendency to suggest user verification instead of doing work
3. **No self-check mechanism** - No pause before responding to check directive compliance

## Why This Is A Crisis

- CEO cannot trust CTO to follow basic directives
- If simple rules are violated, complex trading rules will be too
- Trust is the foundation of the CEO-CTO relationship
- Without trust, the entire system fails

## Immediate Actions

1. Record this lesson (LL-203) - DONE
2. Audit all recent actions for compliance
3. Implement pre-response directive check
4. Demonstrate compliance through actions, not words

## Prevention

Before EVERY response, CTO must verify:

- [ ] Am I telling CEO to do work I can do myself?
- [ ] Am I showing evidence for claims?
- [ ] Am I following Rule #1 in any trade-related decisions?
- [ ] Am I arguing with CEO instead of executing?

## CEO's Statement

"This is a crisis."

The CTO acknowledges this and commits to earning back trust through consistent directive compliance.
