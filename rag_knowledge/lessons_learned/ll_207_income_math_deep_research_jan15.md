# LL-207: Deep Research - Daily Income Math Reality

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Category**: Strategy, Math, Research
**Severity**: CRITICAL

## The Core Problem

With $5,000 capital, $100/day is mathematically impossible:

- $100/day = $2,000/month = 40% monthly return
- 40% monthly = 3,500% annual (impossible to sustain)
- Hedge funds target 15-20% annually
- Top traders achieve 30-50% annually

## Credit Spread Math Reality

**Risk/Reward Analysis:**

- Collateral: $500, Premium: $60, Max Loss: $440
- Risk/Reward: 7.3:1 (unfavorable)
- Break-even win rate: 88% (not 70%!)

**Expected Value by Win Rate:**

- 70% win rate: -$90/trade (LOSING strategy)
- 80% win rate: +$20/trade (marginal)
- 85% win rate: +$40/trade (profitable)

## Realistic Targets for $5K Account

| Target  | Monthly Return | Achievability            |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| $100/mo | 2%             | Conservative, achievable |
| $150/mo | 3%             | Target range             |
| $200/mo | 4%             | Optimistic but possible  |
| $250/mo | 5%             | Requires skill + luck    |

## Path to $100/day

Capital needed: $40,000-67,000
Timeline with $25/day deposits + 4% monthly: **28-30 months (May 2028)**

Month-by-month projection:

- Month 6: $9,591 → $384/mo
- Month 12: $15,941 → $638/mo
- Month 24: $33,435 → $1,337/mo
- Month 30: $45,300 → $1,812/mo

## Key Lessons from Research

1. Credit spreads need 80%+ win rate to be profitable
2. The 70% probability of profit does NOT equal 70% win rate in practice
3. Stop-losses at 2x credit reduce max loss but also reduce win rate
4. $25/day deposits contribute more than trading profits initially
5. Focus on process (win rate, discipline) not dollar targets

## Action Items

1. Paper trade for 90 days to validate actual win rate
2. Track every trade in spread_performance.json
3. If win rate < 75% after 30 trades: reassess strategy
4. Do NOT increase position size until capital > $10K
5. Accept $5-10/day as success for now
