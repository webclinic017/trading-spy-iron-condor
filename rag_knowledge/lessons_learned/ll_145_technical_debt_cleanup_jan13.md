# LL-145: Technical Debt Cleanup - Dead Code Removal

**Date**: January 13, 2026
**Category**: Architecture
**Severity**: HIGH

## Summary

Comprehensive audit using 5 parallel agents found 61 issues. Removed 23 dead files:

- 5 dead agent stubs (always returned empty/False)
- 18 dead scripts (never called by any workflow)

## Dead Agent Stubs Deleted

- fallback_strategy.py - Always returned {"action": "hold"}
- meta_agent.py - Always returned {"consensus": None}
- research_agent.py - Always returned hardcoded template
- signal_agent.py - Always returned []
- risk_agent.py - Duplicated RiskManager functionality

## Dead Scripts Deleted

- credit_spread_trader.py (duplicate of execute_credit_spread.py)
- 17 utility scripts never referenced in workflows

## Duplicate Lesson IDs Fixed

- ll_132 had 2 files → renamed duplicate to ll_143
- ll_135 had 2 files → renamed duplicate to ll_144
- ll_138 deleted (duplicate of ll_136)

## Prevention

1. Before creating new agent stub, document implementation plan
2. Before creating new script, verify it will be called by workflow
3. Check lesson ID uniqueness: `ls rag_knowledge/lessons_learned/ | cut -d_ -f1-2 | sort | uniq -d`
