## Context

Our current strategy focuses on PUT credit spreads (bullish bias). Call credit spreads provide the bearish/neutral complement, enabling market-neutral income generation when stocks appear overextended.

## When to Use Call Credit Spreads

### Market Conditions

- Stock has rallied aggressively and appears to be "peaking"
- Bearish or neutral outlook on underlying
- Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions
- Ideal for generating passive income on overextended stocks

### Technical Entry Signals

1. **Bollinger Bands**: Enter when stock is near or above upper band (20-day, 2 std dev)
2. **RSI**: Overbought conditions (RSI > 70) suggest reversal or sideways movement likely
3. **Use technical levels as "buffer"** for strike selection - resistance levels add safety

## Contract Specifications (Invest with Henry Method)

| Parameter     | Recommendation     | Notes                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Expiration    | 60+ DTE (2 months) | Longer expiry = higher premiums, more passive |
| Delta         | 0.15-0.20          | 85% implied win rate                          |
| Spread Width  | $300-$500          | Narrow spreads have poor liquidity            |
| Position Size | 10% max capital    | More aggressive than our 5% rule              |

### Note on Delta Selection

- 0.15 delta = ~85% probability of profit (OTM at expiration)
- This is MORE conservative than our 0.30 delta for put spreads
- Henry targets higher win rate with lower premium per trade

## Risk Management Rules

1. **Position Sizing**: 10% max capital per trade (we use stricter 5%)
2. **Diversification**: Maintain 10-12 positions across different underlyings
3. **Balance**: Combine call AND put credit spreads for market neutrality
4. **Monitoring**: Check weekly, not daily - avoid "babysitting"

## Trade Management

### If Trade Goes Against You (Stock Rallies)

- **Roll "Up and Out"**: Higher strike, further expiration
- Collect additional credit on the roll if possible
- Accept losses objectively - 1 in 20 losing trades is normal for professionals

### Key Difference from Put Spreads

| Aspect         | Put Credit Spread | Call Credit Spread    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Bias           | Bullish           | Bearish/Neutral       |
| Threatened by  | Market drops      | Market rallies        |
| Roll direction | Down and out      | Up and out            |
| When to use    | Support levels    | Resistance/overbought |

## Integration with Our Current Strategy

### Complementary Approach

- **PUT credit spreads**: Use when market/stock at support, bullish outlook
- **CALL credit spreads**: Use when market/stock at resistance, overbought
- **Combined**: Market-neutral income generation regardless of direction

### Modifications for Our $5K Account

Given our capital constraints:

- Stick to 5% position sizing (not 10%)
- Focus on SPY/IWM for liquidity
- Use 45-60 DTE (balance premium vs. time risk)
- Target 0.15-0.20 delta for higher win rate

## Example Trade (Hypothetical)

```
Stock: SPY at $480 (near upper Bollinger Band, RSI = 75)
Outlook: Expect pullback or sideways movement

Sell: $490 call (0.15 delta)
Buy: $495 call (0.10 delta)
Expiration: 60 DTE
Net Credit: ~$80
Max Risk: $420 ($500 width - $80 credit)
Max Profit: $80 (if SPY stays below $490)
```

## Prevention (How to Avoid Losing Trades)

1. Only enter when technical signals align (overbought, near resistance)
2. Use 0.15-0.20 delta for 85%+ implied probability
3. Allow 60+ DTE for time to work in your favor
4. Roll up and out if challenged, don't panic close
5. Diversify with both call AND put spreads

## Key Takeaways

1. **Call credit spreads = bearish/neutral complement** to our bullish put spreads
2. **Technical confirmation required**: Bollinger Bands + RSI overbought
3. **Higher delta = higher win rate**: 0.15-0.20 delta vs. our 0.30 for puts
4. **Longer duration**: 60+ DTE for passive income approach
5. **Losses are normal**: 1 in 20 losing trades is acceptable for professionals

## Action Items for Our System

1. Consider adding call credit spread capability to strategy options
2. Update technical analysis to identify overbought conditions
3. Track call vs. put spread performance separately
4. Maintain market-neutral bias with balanced spread portfolio
