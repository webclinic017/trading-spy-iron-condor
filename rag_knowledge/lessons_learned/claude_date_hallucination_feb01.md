# LL-324: Claude Hallucinated Super Bowl Date

**Date**: February 1, 2026
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Category**: CTO Accountability / Trust Violation

## What Happened
Claude wrote "It's Super Bowl weekend" on the homepage (docs/index.md) on February 1, 2026. Super Bowl LX is actually February 8, 2026 - one week later.

## Root Cause
- Claude did not verify the Super Bowl date before writing it
- No fact-checking on calendar/date claims
- Chain-of-Verification protocol was not applied to content writing

## Impact
- CEO lost trust in Claude's factual claims
- Public-facing website had incorrect information
- Demonstrates Claude can hallucinate even simple facts

## Fix Applied
- Removed the incorrect Super Bowl reference from homepage
- Commit: fdec3e0b

## Prevention
- ALWAYS verify dates/events with external sources before publishing
- Never assume calendar knowledge is accurate
- Apply Chain-of-Verification to ALL factual claims, not just code

## Lesson
Claude's knowledge cutoff means calendar events may be wrong. When writing date-specific content:
1. Check current date via `date` command
2. Verify event dates via web search if uncertain
3. Prefer generic phrasing ("the weekend") over specific claims ("Super Bowl weekend")
