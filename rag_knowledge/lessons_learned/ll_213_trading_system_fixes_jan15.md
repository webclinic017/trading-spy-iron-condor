# LL-213: Critical Trading System Fixes - Jan 15, 2026

**ID**: LL-213
**Date**: January 15, 2026
**Severity**: RESOLVED
**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-21
**Resolution**: All bugs documented in this lesson were fixed on Jan 15
**Category**: Bug Fixes / System Recovery

## CEO Question Addressed

"Why aren't we making money in our 5K paper trading account even though we had good success in the 100K paper trading account?"

## Root Cause Analysis (From RAG)

### 1. $100K Account Lessons Were NEVER Recorded (LL-203)

- Account declined from ~$100K to ~$5K over weeks/months
- ZERO lessons were recorded during this period
- No trade data, win/loss analysis, or strategy evaluation preserved
- Massive RAG system failure

### 2. We Ignored What Actually Worked

From archived trade data (Dec 2025), the $100K account was:

- Selling puts on SPY and AMD (premium collection)
- Using iron condors (defined risk, 1.5:1 reward/risk)
- Consolidated to SPY focus after Dec 30

**What Generated the +$16,661 on Jan 7:**

1. SPY position appreciation during market rally
2. Options premium decay on short puts expiring worthless
3. Concentrated SPY exposure

### 3. $5K Account Mistakes

Instead of replicating the $100K success, we:

- Changed from SPY to SOFI (untested ticker)
- Used naked puts instead of spreads (undefined risk)
- Put 96% of account on one position (vs 5% rule)
- Traded through earnings (SOFI earnings Jan 30)

## Bugs Fixed Today

### Bug 1: Peak Equity Blocking All Trades

- **Problem**: `peak_equity` was $50,000 (from $100K account)
- **Effect**: System calculated 90% drawdown, blocking ALL trades
- **Fix**: Reset `peak_equity` to $4,959.26 in `trade_gateway_state.json`

### Bug 2: Strategy Name Mismatch

- **Problem**: Trade gateway used "bull_put_spread" but capital calculator only knew "vertical_spread"
- **Effect**: All credit spreads rejected as "Strategy not viable"
- **Fix**: Added `bull_put_spread` and `credit_spread` to `capital_efficiency.py` with $1,000 min capital

### Bug 3: RAG Over-Blocking

- **Problem**: RAG check blocked ANY trade with CRITICAL lessons (even unrelated)
- **Effect**: SOFI lessons about earnings were blocking SPY trades
- **Fix**: Modified RAG check to only block if lesson SPECIFICALLY mentions the ticker being traded

## Verification (All Tests Pass)

```
Test 1: SPY Credit Spread → APPROVED ✅
Test 2: SOFI Trade → BLOCKED (whitelist, blackout, RAG) ✅
Test 3: IWM Credit Spread → APPROVED ✅

## Key Insight

**The $100K account already told us what works:**

1. Sell puts on SPY
2. Use defined risk (iron condors/spreads)
3. Keep positions simple
4. Don't overthink it

**Stop ignoring our own success data.**

## Files Changed

- `src/risk/capital_efficiency.py`: Added bull_put_spread, credit_spread strategies
- `src/risk/trade_gateway.py`: Fixed RAG ticker-specific blocking
- `data/trade_gateway_state.json`: Reset peak_equity to current balance

## Prevention

1. Record every trade in RAG immediately
2. Follow the proven SPY/IWM strategy
3. Never exceed 5% position size
4. Trust the guardrails - they exist for a reason
