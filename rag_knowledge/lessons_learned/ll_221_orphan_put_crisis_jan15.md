# LL-221: CRISIS - Orphan Long Put Created $53 Loss

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Date: 2026-01-15

## Issue

System created an orphan LONG put position (SPY260220P00660000) costing $307 without a matching short leg. This is NOT a credit spread - it's a naked debit position that loses money as the market rises.

## Evidence

- SPY 660 LONG put: cost $307, currently worth ~$343 (+$36 unrealized GAIN as of Jan 15 4PM)
- No matching 665 or 670 SHORT put to form a spread
- Total account P/L: -$10.19 (-0.20%) as of Jan 15 close (recovered from -$53)

## Root Cause Analysis

The 660 put was bought at 12:17 PM ET on Jan 15, 2026. This strike is:

- Only 5% OTM from SPY at $694 (660/694 = 95%)
- NOT a 30% OTM protective leg as intended by simple_daily_trader.py
- Likely created by execute_credit_spread.py failing to place matching short leg

## Phil Town Rule #1 Violation

This position violates Rule #1 (Don't Lose Money):

- Debit trades (buying puts) have NEGATIVE theta - lose money over time
- No premium collected - pure directional bet on market going DOWN
- Market went UP today, causing immediate loss

## Spreads That ARE Correct

1. SPY 565/570 spread - properly formed bull put spread
2. SPY 595/600 spread - properly formed bull put spread

## Prevention Required

1. **CRITICAL**: Before placing ANY option order, verify the matching leg exists
2. Add position validation after each spread execution
3. Alert if orphan options detected
4. Never buy puts without selling higher strike put first (for bull put spreads)

## Immediate Action

1. HALT all automated trading until root cause fixed
2. Close the orphan 660 put to stop the bleeding
3. Review execute_credit_spread.py for bugs

## Impact

- Direct loss: ~$5 unrealized on 660 put
- Opportunity cost: $307 tied up in losing position
- Trust erosion: System is supposed to MAKE money, not LOSE it

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Trading HALTED via workflow check-trading-halt job (PR #1918)
2. ✅ system_state.json updated with CRISIS status and orphan position note
3. ⏳ Orphan 660 put needs manual closure (PDT restriction)
4. ⏳ execute_credit_spread.py needs fix to verify both legs

## Resolution Criteria (Updated Jan 15, 4:45 PM)

- [x] execute_credit_spread.py validates both legs before submission (lines 450-549)
- [x] SHORT leg submitted FIRST, verified before LONG leg (line 457-484)
- [x] Auto-cancel short if long fails (line 509-513)
- [x] Win rate tracking is implemented (data/trades.json master ledger - PR #1937)
- [ ] Orphan 660 put still open (currently +$36 profit - hold or close? CEO decision)
- [ ] Set halted=false in daily-trading.yml to resume (requires CEO approval)
