# LL-264: Trade History Sync Bug Fix

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Category**: Data Integrity, System Bug
**Severity**: CRITICAL

## The Bug

`sync_alpaca_state.py` was overwriting `data/system_state.json` WITHOUT the `trade_history` field. This caused ALL trade data to be lost on every sync.

**Evidence:**

```
Trade history recorded: 0
```

...despite having 6 open SPY positions.

## Root Cause

Two competing sync processes with different schemas:

| Script                  | trade_history | positions |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `sync_alpaca_state.py`  | NO            | YES       |
| `sync-system-state.yml` | YES           | YES       |

The local script ran more frequently and overwrote the GitHub Actions sync data.

## The Fix (PR pending)

Added trade_history fetching to `sync_alpaca_state.py`:

1. Fetch closed orders from Alpaca API
2. Write to `state["trade_history"]`
3. Add `trades_loaded` count for monitoring
4. Preserve existing history if fetch fails (defensive)

## Why This Matters

This is EXACTLY how we lost the $100K account lessons:

- No trade recording
- No win/loss tracking
- Same mistakes repeated

Without trade_history, we cannot:

- Calculate real win rate
- Learn from past trades
- Validate strategy alignment

## Prevention

1. Single source of truth: `sync_alpaca_state.py` now handles trade_history
2. Schema validation: `trades_loaded` field enables monitoring
3. Defensive preservation: Never delete existing history if fetch fails
