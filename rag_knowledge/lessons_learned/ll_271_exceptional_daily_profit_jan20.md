## Details

### Performance Metrics

- **Daily P/L**: +$85.10 (+1.71%)
- **Previous Equity**: $4,986.39 (Jan 19)
- **Current Equity**: $5,070.66 (Jan 20)
- **Daily Target**: $5-10/day
- **Performance vs Target**: 8.5x exceeding target

### Trades Executed (10 total)

1. Multiple SPY put spread legs at 14:56 UTC
2. SPY share purchases at 15:09 and 16:43 UTC
3. SOFI put (legacy position, losing -$80)

### What Worked

1. **SPY-only focus**: All profitable trades were SPY
2. **Multiple small positions**: Spread risk across trades
3. **Active management**: System executed 10 trades in one day
4. **Defined risk**: Put spreads limited downside

### What Needs Improvement

1. **SOFI position**: Legacy position still losing -$80
2. **Position compliance**: Need to close non-SPY positions
3. **Hook accuracy**: "NO TRADES TODAY" message was incorrect

### North Star Alignment

- Target: $150-200/month (3-4%)
- Today's pace: $1,787/month (projected)
- Status: **ON TRACK** (if even 1/8th of today's pace maintained)

2. SPY volatility provided good premium
3. System executed strategy as designed
