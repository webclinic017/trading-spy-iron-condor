# LL-296: XSP Tax Optimization Recommendation

**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Category**: Tax Optimization / Strategy
**Severity**: HIGH (CEO Decision Required)
**Related**: LL-295 (Four Pillars of Wealth Building)

## Executive Summary

Research indicates switching from SPY to XSP (Mini-SPX) iron condors could save **~30% on taxes** through Section 1256 60/40 treatment, adding **$15,000-20,000** to the account over 7 years.

## Current State

- **Strategy**: SPY iron condors only (per CLAUDE.md)
- **Tax treatment**: 100% short-term capital gains (~32% tax rate)
- **Account**: $30,000

## Proposed Change

Switch from SPY to **XSP (Mini-SPX)** iron condors.

## Why XSP vs SPX?

| Feature                | SPY            | XSP               | SPX               |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Contract value         | ~$590          | ~$590             | ~$5,900           |
| Position size for $30K | ✅ Fits        | ✅ Fits           | ❌ Too large      |
| Tax treatment          | Short-term     | **60/40**         | **60/40**         |
| Assignment risk        | Yes (American) | **No (European)** | **No (European)** |
| Cash settled           | No             | **Yes**           | **Yes**           |
| Wash sale rules        | Apply          | **Don't apply**   | **Don't apply**   |

**XSP is ideal for $30K account** - same size as SPY, better tax treatment.

## Tax Math (Section 1256)

```
SPY (short-term only):
  $10,000 gains × 32% = $3,200 tax

XSP (60/40 treatment):
  $6,000 (60%) × 15% long-term = $900
  $4,000 (40%) × 32% short-term = $1,280
  Total: $2,180 tax

Savings: $1,020 (31.9%)
```

## 7-Year Projection

| Year | Pre-Tax Gains | SPY Tax | XSP Tax | Cumulative Savings  |
| ---- | ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | $5,400        | $1,728  | $1,210  | $518                |
| 2    | $7,900        | $2,528  | $1,770  | $1,276              |
| 3    | $11,600       | $3,712  | $2,598  | $2,390              |
| 5    | $25,000       | $8,000  | $5,600  | ~$5,000             |
| 7    | $50,000+      | $16,000 | $11,200 | **~$15,000-20,000** |

## Risk Considerations

1. **Liquidity**: XSP less liquid than SPY (wider bid-ask spreads)
2. **Fills**: May get slightly worse fills
3. **Learning curve**: Different option chain structure
4. **Broker support**: Verify TastyTrade supports XSP

## Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Paper Trading)**: Test XSP iron condors alongside SPY for 30 days
**Phase 2 (Small Live)**: If fills acceptable, switch 50% of trades to XSP
**Phase 3 (Full Migration)**: If Phase 2 successful, fully migrate to XSP

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] CEO approves XSP testing
2. [ ] Add XSP to paper trading watchlist
3. [ ] Compare XSP vs SPY bid-ask spreads
4. [ ] Run parallel paper trades for 30 days
5. [ ] Analyze fill quality and slippage
6. [ ] Update CLAUDE.md strategy if approved

## Infrastructure Ready

The `iron_condor_backtester.py` already supports XSP:

```bash
python scripts/backtest/iron_condor_backtester.py --ticker XSP --days 90
```
