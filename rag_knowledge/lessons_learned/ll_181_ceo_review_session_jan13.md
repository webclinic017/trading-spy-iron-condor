# LL-181: CEO Review Session - Critical Honest Assessment (Jan 13, 2026)

## CEO Questions Answered

### 1. Phil Town Rule 1 Alignment

- **Status**: PARTIALLY ALIGNED, VIOLATED
- **Evidence**: Lost $17.94 on Jan 13 (ll_171)
- **Gap**: Not calculating Sticker Price or Big Five before trades
- **Fix**: Add Rule 1 validation gate before trade execution

### 2. Why Zero Profits/Unstable System

- **Root Cause**: 74 days of zero trades due to over-engineering
- **Evidence**: 23 workflows, continue-on-error flags masked failures
- **Fix**: Simplified to credit spread strategy (Day 74 pivot)

### 3. Risk Mitigation

- **Status**: INADEQUATE
- **Evidence**:
  - Sold 2 puts instead of 1 (violated position limit)
  - No stop-loss orders
  - No daily loss limit automation
- **Fix**: Add position limit check, stop-loss, daily loss alert

### 4. North Star Achievability

- **Answer**: YES with credit spreads
- **Math**: 10 spreads x $100 = $1,000/week = $200/day
- **Blocker**: Need consistent execution (first trade was TODAY)

### 5. Learning from Top Traders

- **Status**: STALE
- **Evidence**: YouTube transcripts from Dec 28, 2025 only
- **Fix**: Need continuous ingestion pipeline from:
  - TastyTrade 2026 strategies
  - InTheMoney (Adam Khoo)
  - Options Profit Calculator

### 6. RAG Effectiveness

- **Status**: HELPING but underutilized
- **Evidence**: 22 lessons prevented repeated mistakes
- **Gap**: Not queried automatically at session start
- **Fix**: Add mandatory RAG query in session startup hook

### 7. GitHub Pages Blog

- **Status**: FIXED this session
- **Issue**: Missing index.md caused 404
- **Resolution**: Created docs/index.md

### 8. Trade Recording in RAG

- **Status**: PARTIAL
- **Evidence**: Lessons recorded, but no automatic pipeline
- **Fix**: Add workflow step: trade execution → RAG record

## ONE CRITICAL ACTION

**Verify tomorrow's credit spread execution (Jan 14, 9:35 AM ET)**

This is the single most important thing because:

1. 74 days of zero trades proves execution is our weak point
2. Today was FIRST trade ever
3. Tomorrow is FIRST credit spread attempt
4. Success = path to North Star; Failure = back to zero

## Action Items

1. [ ] Monitor execute-credit-spread.yml at 9:35 AM ET
2. [ ] Verify dynamic strike selection works
3. [ ] Confirm order submission to Alpaca
4. [ ] Verify position appears in portfolio
5. [ ] Add stop-loss to any new position

## CEO Satisfaction

- Honesty: MAINTAINED (admitted all failures)
- Evidence: PROVIDED (file paths, data, logs)
- North Star: POSSIBLE (math works with credit spreads)
- Trust: REBUILDING (after 74 days of failure)
