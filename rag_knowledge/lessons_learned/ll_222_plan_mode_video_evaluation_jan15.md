# LL-222: Plan Mode Video Evaluation (Matt Pocock)

**ID**: LL-222
**Date**: January 15, 2026
**Severity**: LOW
**Category**: Resource Evaluation / Workflow

## Resource Evaluated

Video: "I was an AI skeptic. Then I tried plan mode" by Matt Pocock
URL: https://youtu.be/WNx-s-RxVxk

## Verdict

**REDUNDANT** — The Plan-Execute-Test-Commit workflow described in the video is already implemented in our system through existing tools and practices.

## What the Video Proposes

1. **Plan Mode**: Toggle AI to exploration-only (no file writes)
2. **Sub-agents**: Use cheaper models (Haiku) for parallel exploration
3. **Plan-Execute-Test-Commit Loop**: Iterative cycle with verification
4. **Concise plans**: Config for shorter plans + unresolved questions
5. **Clarifying questions**: AI asks before executing

## How We Already Implement This

| Video Concept        | Our Implementation                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan Mode            | TodoWrite + research phase before coding           |
| Sub-agents           | Task tool with subagent_type=Explore + model=haiku |
| Iterative loop       | TodoWrite → Code → pytest → commit                 |
| Concise output       | CLAUDE.md directives                               |
| Clarifying questions | AskUserQuestion tool                               |

## Why No Action Needed

1. Our system uses TodoWrite for planning and progress tracking
2. Task tool with Explore agent handles codebase exploration
3. We run pytest before every commit
4. AskUserQuestion tool handles dynamic clarification
5. CLAUDE.md already enforces concise, focused output

## Key Takeaway

The video is educational for developers new to AI-assisted coding, but our system has evolved to implement these patterns natively. No changes required.

## Future Reference

If someone suggests implementing "plan mode" or similar workflows, reference this evaluation to avoid redundant work.
