# LL-244: Adversarial Audit - Complete System Vulnerability Assessment

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Category**: Security, Audit, System Architecture
**Severity**: HIGH
**Resolution Date**: 2026-01-21
**Resolution**: Main findings fixed per PR #2193 (disabled conflicting traders, added compliance tests)

## Summary

Comprehensive adversarial audit revealed 10 critical findings in the trading system. Primary issue: code executed OPPOSITE of documented strategy in CLAUDE.md, exposing account to unlimited loss.

## Key Findings (Executive Summary)

| Finding                                         | Severity | Status           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Strategy mismatch (naked puts vs iron condors)  | CRITICAL | FIXED (PR #2193) |
| Position sizing bypass (15-30% vs 5% limit)     | CRITICAL | PARTIALLY FIXED  |
| Data corruption (null symbols, negative prices) | CRITICAL | KNOWN            |
| Holiday trading without validation              | HIGH     | KNOWN            |
| Multiple uncoordinated traders                  | HIGH     | FIXED (disabled) |
| Naked puts execution                            | CRITICAL | FIXED (disabled) |

## Critical Fix Applied (PR #2193)

### Disabled Conflicting Traders in daily-trading.yml:

- `simple_daily_trader.py` - Sells NAKED puts (undefined risk)
- `rule_one_trader.py` - Trades individual stocks (F, SOFI, etc.)
- `guaranteed_trader.py` - Buys SPY shares (not iron condors)

### Added Compliance Test

- `tests/test_claudemd_compliance.py` - Validates code matches CLAUDE.md
- 10/12 tests pass
- 2 xfail tests for known position limit violations

### Added Position Closer

- `scripts/close_excess_spreads.py` - Closes excess positions when market opens

## Root Cause

The $5K account failed because:

1. **74 days of zero trades** - Over-engineered gates blocked all opportunities
2. **Panic pivot to SOFI** - Picked blacklisted stock, violated 5% rule
3. **Code/strategy mismatch** - 4 traders made independent decisions

The $100K account succeeded because:

1. Human decisions (not over-automated)
2. SPY only
3. Iron condors (defined risk)
4. Disciplined position sizing

## Remaining Issues

1. **Position limit violated** - Currently 6 positions (3 spreads) vs 4 max
2. **5% limit exceeded** - $570 position vs $249 limit
3. **Data staleness** - No alerts when sync fails

## Fix Schedule

- **Jan 20, 9:35 AM ET**: Run `close_excess_spreads.py` to close 2 of 3 spreads
- **Jan 20**: Remove xfail markers after positions closed
- **This Week**: Add holiday validation to daily-trading.yml

## Phil Town Alignment

This audit enforces Rule #1: "Don't Lose Money"

- Naked puts: Unlimited loss → DISABLED
- Iron condors: Defined risk → ENABLED
- 5% position limit: Maximum loss capped

## Prevention

1. **CLAUDE.md compliance test** - Now runs in CI
2. **Single trader architecture** - iron_condor_trader.py only
3. **Pre-trade checklist IN CODE** - Not just documentation
