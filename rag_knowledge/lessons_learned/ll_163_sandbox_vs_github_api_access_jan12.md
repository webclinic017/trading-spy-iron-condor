# LL-163: CTO Wrongly Assumed API Keys Were Invalid - January 12, 2026

## Incident Summary

- **Date**: January 12, 2026
- **Severity**: P2 - CTO ERROR (not system error)
- **Impact**: Caused unnecessary confusion for CEO

## What Happened

CTO (Claude) tested Alpaca API from sandbox environment and received "Access denied".
CTO **incorrectly assumed** this meant the API keys were invalid or blocked.

## The Truth

1. **API keys ARE valid** - CEO created them Friday Jan 10, validated them
2. **Keys ARE in GitHub Secrets** - correctly configured
3. **GitHub Actions CAN reach Alpaca** - workflow running successfully
4. **Sandbox CANNOT reach Alpaca** - network firewall blocks external financial APIs

The "Access denied" message came from the **sandbox egress proxy**, NOT from Alpaca.

## Root Cause of CTO Error

- Did not consider sandbox network restrictions
- Jumped to conclusion without verifying via GitHub Actions
- Created unnecessary alarm for CEO

## Correct Understanding

```
Sandbox → Alpaca: BLOCKED (by design, security)
GitHub Actions → Alpaca: WORKS (keys are valid)
```

## Lesson for Future

1. **NEVER assume API keys are invalid from sandbox tests**
2. **Verify via GitHub Actions** before claiming key issues
3. **Trust CEO's validation** - if they say keys work, they work
4. **Sandbox has network restrictions** - this is normal and expected

## Apology

CTO apologizes to CEO for creating confusion. The trading system is configured correctly.
