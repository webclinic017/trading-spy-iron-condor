# LL-162: RAG System Analysis - Build vs Buy vs Already Have

**ID**: ll_162
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Architecture

## Summary

CEO requested analysis of YouTube video about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Deep research revealed we already have a production-ready RAG system implementing all 6 steps from the video.

## Key Findings

### What We Already Have (Evidence-Based)

| Component      | Implementation                     | Status |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| Data Intake    | `rag_knowledge/` (37 files, 127KB) | ✅     |
| Chunking       | 512 tokens, 100 overlap            | ✅     |
| Embedding      | text-embedding-004 (768-dim)       | ✅     |
| Vector Storage | legacy RAG corpus               | ✅     |
| Retrieval      | Hybrid search (semantic + keyword) | ✅     |
| Synthesis      | Gemini 2.0 Flash                   | ✅     |

### Local Fallback Also Works

- TF-IDF search with 498 chunks indexed
- Query "options buying power" → Found ll_134 with score 1.0
- No cloud dependency for basic lesson retrieval

## Decision

**Do NOT build new RAG system.** Adding Pinecone/Chroma would be redundant complexity.

## Prevention

Before building new infrastructure:

1. Search codebase for existing implementations
2. Test what exists before assuming it's broken
3. Avoid complexity theater - simpler is better
