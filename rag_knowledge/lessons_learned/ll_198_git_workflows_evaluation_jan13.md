# LL-198: Git Workflows Video Evaluation

**Date**: January 13, 2026
**Source**: "3 Git Workflows Every Developer Should Know" by TechWorld with Nana
**Link**: https://youtu.be/GQQqf-C2ha4

## Summary Verdict

> **REDUNDANT** — We already implement GitHub Flow correctly with extensive CI automation.

## What the Video Proposes

### 1. Git Flow (Traditional)

- Long-lived branches: main, develop, feature, release, hotfix
- For versioned software (mobile apps, desktop, enterprise)
- **Verdict**: Overkill for our continuous deployment web/automation system

### 2. GitHub Flow (Simple)

- Main is always deployable
- Short-lived feature branches
- PR + review + merge + deploy
- **Verdict**: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

### 3. Trunk-Based Development (High-Performance)

- Direct commits to main or <1 day branches
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Extreme automation required
- **Verdict**: Possible upgrade but unnecessary at our scale

### Best Practices Mentioned

- Automate everything (testing, linting, security, deployment)
- Document your process
- Measure DORA metrics

## How We Compare

| Practice               | Video Recommends | Our Status                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Main always deployable | ✅               | ✅ Have it                |
| PR-based workflow      | ✅               | ✅ Have it                |
| Automated testing      | ✅               | ✅ 15+ test stages        |
| Linting                | ✅               | ✅ ruff check/format      |
| Security scanning      | ✅               | ✅ bandit, detect-secrets |
| Code review            | ✅               | ✅ PR review required     |
| Document workflow      | ✅               | ❌ No CONTRIBUTING.md     |
| DORA metrics           | ✅               | ❌ Not tracked            |
| Feature flags          | For TBD          | ❌ Not needed             |

## Operational Impact Assessment

| Criterion                    | Assessment                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Improves reliability?        | No — already have extensive CI           |
| Improves security?           | No — already have security scans         |
| Improves profitability?      | No — workflow doesn't affect trading     |
| Reduces complexity?          | No — we're already at optimal simplicity |
| Adds unnecessary complexity? | N/A — nothing to add                     |

## Action Items

- [x] Evaluate video content — DONE
- [ ] Optional: Add CONTRIBUTING.md if team grows
- [ ] Optional: Track DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time)

## Conclusion

This is **educational content we've already internalized**. Our CI/CD pipeline with 30+ workflows is more comprehensive than what the video describes. No changes needed.
