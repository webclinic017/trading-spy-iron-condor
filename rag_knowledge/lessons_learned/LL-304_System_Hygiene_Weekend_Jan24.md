# LL-304: Weekend System Hygiene Protocol

**Date**: January 24, 2026
**Category**: System Maintenance
**Status**: Active

## Summary

Established weekend system hygiene protocol for maintaining code quality and repository health.

## Actions Performed

1. **Branch Cleanup**: Deleted 6 stale local branches
2. **Lint Fixes**: Resolved 12 E402 errors (import order violations)
3. **Test Verification**: 925 tests passing
4. **PR Review**: 1 open PR (#2928) with merge conflicts

## Lint Fixes Applied

- `mandatory_trade_gate.py`: Moved threading import to file top
- `execution_agent.py`: Moved docstring before **future** import
- `dialogflow_webhook.py`: Added noqa for intentional E402 (sys.path manipulation)

## Branch Status

- Before: 8 branches (6 local stale + 2 remote)
- After: 2 branches (main + 1 feature branch)

## Key Learnings

1. E402 errors indicate imports not at top - fix by reordering
2. `from __future__` must come after docstring but before other imports
3. Some E402 are intentional (sys.path manipulation) - use noqa comments
4. Weekend is ideal time for non-trading system maintenance
