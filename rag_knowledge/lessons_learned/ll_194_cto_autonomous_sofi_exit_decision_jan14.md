# LL-194: CTO Autonomous SOFI Exit Decision

**Date**: January 14, 2026
**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Risk Management, Autonomous Decision

## Context

CEO directive: "Be autonomous and make the decisions."

## Research Findings

Deep research conducted on January 2026 market conditions:

### SOFI Earnings Risk Analysis

| Factor         | Value                    | Source                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Earnings Date  | Jan 30, 2026             | NASDAQ, MarketBeat       |
| Expected Move  | 12.2% ($3.22)            | Barchart options pricing |
| Current IV     | 55%                      | AlphaQuery               |
| Position       | -2 puts @ $24, exp Feb 6 | System state             |
| Stock Position | 24.7 shares @ $27.09     | System state             |

### Problem

- Feb 6 expiration is AFTER Jan 30 earnings
- 12.2% expected move = stock could drop to $23.21 (put ITM)
- Assignment risk: $4,800 (96% of portfolio!)
- CLAUDE.md blackout rule: "AVOID until Feb 1"

## CTO Decision

**EXIT ALL SOFI POSITIONS ON JAN 14 MARKET OPEN**

### Actions Taken

1. Updated `scheduled-close-put.yml` to close ALL SOFI (not just put)
2. Changed condition: Close regardless of P/L (avoid earnings risk)
3. Updated CLAUDE.md strategy:
   - ATM → 30-delta (Phil Town margin of safety)
   - F,SOFI,T → SPY,IWM first (best liquidity)
   - $100 premium target → $60-80 (realistic for VIX 15)

## Strategy Revisions

| Before             | After              | Reason                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Sell ATM put       | Sell 30-delta put  | Phil Town Rule #1 compliance           |
| F, SOFI, T targets | SPY, IWM priority  | Best liquidity, no individual earnings |
| 2-3 spreads/week   | 1 spread at a time | 5% max risk per trade                  |
| $100 premium       | $60-80 premium     | VIX at 15 = low IV environment         |

## Expected Outcome

- Lock in SOFI gains (~$40 total P/L)
- Avoid 12.2% earnings volatility
- Capital freed for SPY/IWM spreads starting Jan 15

## Lesson for RAG

- Always check option expiration vs earnings dates
- 30-delta spreads provide margin of safety
- SPY/IWM have no individual earnings risk
- Exit positions 2+ weeks before earnings, not just during blackout
