## Violations (What Must Be Fixed)

| Check            | Rule                    | Actual              | Violation         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Spread width     | $3-wide ($300 max risk) | $5-wide ($500 risk) | **2x over limit** |
| Position count   | 1 spread at a time      | 3 spreads open      | **3x over limit** |
| Position pairing | All legs paired         | 4 longs, 3 shorts   | **Orphan put**    |

## Root Cause Analysis

### How We Got Here

1. **Day 74**: SOFI mistake caused -$40 loss (LL-158)
2. **Recovery attempt**: Opened multiple SPY spreads to "make back" the loss
3. **Emotion over rules**: Position sizing rules ignored in pursuit of recovery
4. **Orphan creation**: LL-221 documents how 660 put became orphaned

### The Psychology

This is classic **revenge trading** behavior:

- Lost money on SOFI
- Felt pressure to recover
- Opened too many positions
- Violated position limits

Phil Town explicitly warns against this.

## Corrective Actions

### Monday (Jan 20, 2026)

1. **Close orphan 660 put** - Accept ~$24 loss to stop theta bleed
2. **Do NOT open new positions** - Already over-extended
3. **Monitor existing spreads** - Close at 50% profit or 2x loss

### Going Forward

1. **$3-wide spreads ONLY** - Max risk $300, within 5% rule
2. **1 spread at a time** - No exceptions until account > $10K
3. **No revenge trading** - Accept losses, don't compound them
4. **Record before trade** - Write RAG entry BEFORE entering

## Math Validation

| Metric         | Current        | Correct        |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Account        | $4,974.08      | $4,974.08      |
| 5% max risk    | $248.70        | $248.70        |
| Spread width   | $5 ($500 risk) | $3 ($300 risk) |
| Position count | 3              | 1              |
| Total exposure | $1,500 (30%)   | $300 (6%)      |

## Key Lesson

**The strategy is correct. The execution violated the rules.**

We knew the rules. We documented them in CLAUDE.md. We just didn't follow them when emotions took over after the SOFI loss.

Rule #1 isn't just about the math - it's about the discipline to follow the rules even when it feels wrong.

## Prevention

Add to pre-trade checklist:

- [ ] Is this revenge trading? (Emotionally motivated?)
- [ ] Have I waited 24 hours after a loss?
- [ ] Am I following position limits or making excuses?
