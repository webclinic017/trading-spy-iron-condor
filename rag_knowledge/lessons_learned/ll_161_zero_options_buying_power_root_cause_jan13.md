# LL-161: Options Buying Power $0 Despite $5K Cash - Root Cause

**ID**: ll_161
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Severity**: CRITICAL

## Problem

74 days into trading, $0 profit. Paper account has $5,000 cash but options_buying_power shows $0. All CSP orders are rejected. System appears operational but executes zero trades.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Stale pending orders** consume buying power as collateral
2. **Previous short put positions** may still be open
3. **Alpaca paper trading** may have margin calculation bugs
4. **Workflow runs successfully** but trading step silently fails

## Evidence

- system_state.json: total_trades=0, last_trade_date=2026-01-06
- ll_134: Documented options_buying_power=$0 issue
- Workflow has cancel_stale_orders.py but it's not clearing the blockage

## Solution

1. MANUAL INTERVENTION: Cancel ALL open orders via Alpaca dashboard
2. SWITCH STRATEGY: Buy equity (SOFI) instead of CSP until buying power fixed
3. MONITOR: Check workflow runs for "ORDER_REJECTED" errors
4. ESCALATE: Contact Alpaca support if buying power stays $0

## Prevention

1. Add pre-trade check: if options_buying_power < required_collateral, SKIP options and BUY EQUITY instead
2. Alert CEO when options_buying_power=$0 for >24 hours
3. Don't rely on CSP strategy alone - have equity fallback

## Phil Town Rule 1 Impact

Cannot lose money if we're not making trades. But we're also not making profits. This violates the spirit of Rule 1 - capital must be deployed productively.
