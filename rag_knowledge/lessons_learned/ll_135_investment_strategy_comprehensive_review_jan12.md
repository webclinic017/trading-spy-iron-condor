**ID**: ll_135
**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Strategy Audit

## Summary

CEO requested comprehensive audit of all trading systems. CTO conducted thorough investigation with evidence-based answers to 15+ questions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Phil Town Rule #1: IMPLEMENTED but INACTIVE

- Code: `src/strategies/rule_one_options.py` (1,091 lines)
- Constants: MARR=15%, MOS=50%, MIN_RETURN=12%
- Status: Cannot execute - live account $60 (need $500 for CSP)

### 2. Profitability: NOT LOSING (but not trading either)

- Total P/L: $0.00 (0% loss)
- Total trades on live account: 0
- Reason: In accumulation phase ($10/day deposits)

### 3. Risk Management: CONFIGURED but NO POSITIONS

- Stop loss: 50% (fixed from 200% on Jan 9)
- Position size: 10% max
- Delta: 30 (70% OTM probability)
- No violations possible with zero exposure

### 4. RAG Database: HEALTHY but UNDERUTILIZED

- 5 lessons learned
- 23 YouTube video insights
- Local file-based (cost-optimized)

### 5. Dashboard: FIXED (was showing stale data)

- Updated brokerage capital: $60 (was showing $4,998.98)
- Updated next goal: "Reach $500 for first CSP"

### 6. Tests: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED

- Before: 5 collection errors
- After: 386 passed, 36 skipped, 5 failed (sandbox deps)

## Critical Discovery: OPTIONS_BUYING_POWER=$0

Paper account shows $5K cash but $0 options buying power. This is the #1 blocker for paper trading.

## Path to North Star ($100/day)

| Milestone   | Capital | Timeline   |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| First CSP   | $500    | ~44 days   |
| Full Wheel  | $2,000  | ~6 months  |
| Target rate | $20,000 | ~18 months |

Requires 12-15% annualized returns with compounding.

## Action Items

1. Fix options_buying_power=$0 bug (cancel stale orders)
2. Continue $10/day deposits until $500
3. Start paper CSPs on F ($5 strike) when buying power restored
4. Record all trades in RAG once trading begins

## Prevention Measures

1. Always check buying_power BEFORE submitting options orders
2. Auto-cancel stale orders older than 1 day
3. Verify dashboard data matches system_state.json
4. Keep tests compatible with optional dependencies
