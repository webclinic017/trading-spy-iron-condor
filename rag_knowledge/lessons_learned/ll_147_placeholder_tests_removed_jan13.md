# LL-147: Placeholder Tests Removed for Honesty

**Date**: January 13, 2026
**Category**: Testing
**Severity**: HIGH

## Summary

Removed 14 placeholder tests that only contained `assert True`. These provided false coverage metrics and violated the "Never lie" directive.

## Changes

### test_orchestrator_main.py

Removed 13 placeholder tests in 4 classes:

- TestGateValidation (5 tests) - Real gate tests exist in test_safety_gates.py
- TestOrchestratorErrorHandling (3 tests)
- TestOrchestratorIntegration (2 partial tests)
- TestOrchestratorMetrics (3 tests)

Kept 8 real tests that actually verify behavior.

### test_smoke.py

Replaced 1 placeholder with 5 real smoke tests:

- test_project_structure_exists
- test_core_modules_syntax_valid
- test_trading_constants_reasonable
- test_data_directory_writable
- test_environment_aware

## CI Integration Tests

Found: `SKIP_SLOW_TESTS: 'true'` in ci.yml but no tests check this flag.
It's a no-op - tests run in DRY_RUN mode which is appropriate.

## Prevention

1. Never commit `assert True` as a test - it lies about coverage
2. If test isn't ready, use `pytest.skip("Not implemented")` or don't add it
3. Verify coverage with `pytest --cov` before claiming test coverage
