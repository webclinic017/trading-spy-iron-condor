# LL-206: Why $5K Account Failed - Complete Execution Failure Analysis

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** post-mortem, strategy, execution

## Summary

The $5K paper trading account lost -$40.74 (-0.81%) due to three cascading execution failures over 76 days.

## Phase 1: 74 Days of Zero Trades (Nov 1 - Jan 12)

### Root Causes

| Blocker        | Code Location                              | Impact                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Wrong ticker   | `guaranteed_trader.py` targeted SPY ($580) | Can't afford 100 shares    |
| RSI gate       | Required RSI < 30 OR > 70                  | Blocked 95%+ opportunities |
| RAG gate       | Queried "failures", blocked if found       | Self-sabotage              |
| Cash threshold | Required $5000 cash (line 300)             | Any position = blocked     |

**Result:** 74 days, ZERO profit, ZERO learning.

## Phase 2: Day 74 Emergency Fix (Jan 13)

### What Changed

- SPY → SOFI (affordable stock)
- Removed RSI/RAG gates
- "Buy $100 SOFI daily"

### What Was Missed

- SOFI earnings: Jan 30, 2026
- CLAUDE.md blackout: "SOFI: AVOID until Feb 1"
- Position size: 96% of portfolio (violated 5% rule)

## Phase 3: Blackout Violation & Force-Close (Jan 13-14)

### Timeline

| Date/Time      | Event                           | Impact               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Jan 13 9:35 AM | SOFI CSP opened during blackout | Violation            |
| Jan 14 9:46 AM | Force-close triggered           | -$18.31 options loss |
| Jan 14 EOD     | Total daily loss                | -$65.58              |

### Why Force-Close Was Correct

- Potential loss if held through earnings: -$4,800 (96% of portfolio)
- Actual loss taken: -$40.74 (0.81%)
- Phil Town Rule #1 saved by cutting early

## Comparison: $100K vs $5K Accounts

| $100K Account (Success)     | $5K Account (Failure)    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Human decisions             | Automated with bad gates |
| SPY focus                   | SOFI desperation pick    |
| Iron condors (defined risk) | Naked put (96% exposure) |
| No earnings conflicts       | Traded INTO blackout     |

## Key Lessons

1. **Over-engineering kills execution** - 74 days of zero trades
2. **Panic pivots break rules** - Picked SOFI without checking earnings
3. **Documentation ≠ enforcement** - CLAUDE.md rules weren't in code
4. **Defined risk mandatory** - Credit spreads, not naked positions
5. **Position sizing saves accounts** - 5% rule would have limited loss

## Prevention Going Forward

1. SPY/IWM ONLY - No individual stocks
2. Credit spreads - Defined risk
3. 5% max position - $248 max risk
4. Pre-trade checklist IN CODE - Automated enforcement
5. Earnings blackout check - Block trades automatically
