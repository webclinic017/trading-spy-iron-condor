# LL-293: Iron Condor Optimization for $30K Account

**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Category**: Strategy / Research
**Severity**: HIGH
**Source**: Web research compilation for new paper account

## Context

New $30K paper account established. Need optimized iron condor parameters for:

- Above $25K = NO PDT restrictions
- Target: $400-800/month (1.3-2.7% monthly return)
- Risk: Max 5% per trade ($1,500)

## Optimal Parameters (Research-Backed)

### Entry Criteria

| Parameter    | Value         | Rationale                        |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Underlying   | SPY only      | Best liquidity, tightest spreads |
| Short Delta  | 16-20         | 75-85% probability of profit     |
| Wing Width   | $5            | Defined risk, capital efficient  |
| DTE at Entry | 30-45 days    | Optimal theta decay curve        |
| IV Rank      | >50 preferred | Higher premium collection        |

### Exit Criteria (CRITICAL for 80%+ Win Rate)

| Trigger                | Action          | Rationale                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 50% profit             | CLOSE           | Capture gains, free up capital |
| 7 DTE remaining        | CLOSE           | Gamma risk no longer worth it  |
| 200% of credit loss    | CLOSE           | Stop-loss prevents blowouts    |
| Short delta hits 30-35 | ADJUST or CLOSE | Position challenged            |

### Position Sizing for $30K Account

| Account | Max Risk/Trade | Max Position Size | Concurrent Trades |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| $30,000 | $1,500 (5%)    | 1 iron condor     | 1 at a time       |

**Phil Town Rule**: Never use more than 50% of buying power. With $60K buying power, max deployment = $30K worth of positions.

## Adjustment Strategies (When Challenged)

### If Tested Side Approaches 30 Delta:

1. **Roll untested side closer** - Collect additional credit
2. **Roll tested side out in time** - 21-30 days for credit
3. **Close tested side** - Take partial loss, keep profitable side
4. **Close entire position** - If both sides under pressure

### Adjustment Decision Tree:

```
Position Challenged?
├── >14 DTE remaining?
│   ├── Yes → Wait, price often reverses
│   └── No → Close or roll
├── Loss > 150% of credit?
│   └── Close entire position
└── Untested side profitable?
    └── Close tested, keep untested
```

## Expected Performance (Research-Based)

| Metric         | Conservative | Moderate | Target |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| Win Rate       | 70%          | 75%      | 80%+   |
| Avg Win        | $150         | $200     | $250   |
| Avg Loss       | $300         | $400     | $500   |
| Monthly Trades | 2            | 3        | 4      |
| Monthly Return | 1.0%         | 1.5%     | 2.0%   |

### $30K Account Projections

| Trades/Month | Win Rate | Monthly P/L | Annual P/L |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 2            | 80%      | $220        | $2,640     |
| 3            | 80%      | $330        | $3,960     |
| 4            | 80%      | $440        | $5,280     |

**Note**: These are CONSERVATIVE projections following Phil Town Rule #1.
