# LL-185: North Star Revision - From $100/day to $25/day (Data-Driven)

**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** strategy, risk-management

## The Problem

Original target: **$100/day with $5K capital = 2% daily return**

Research revealed:

- 2% daily = 500% annually (unsustainable)
- Professional fund managers target 15-25% ANNUALLY
- Credit spread win rates: 60-70% realistic
- Our math assumed ~100% win rate (flawed)

### Original Flawed Math

```
10 spreads x $100 = $1,000/week
Assumed: All 10 win
Reality: 7 win, 3 lose at $400 each = NET LOSS
```

## The Solution

Revised target: **$25/day (~$500/month = 10% monthly = 120% annually)**

- Still beats 99% of professional funds
- Achievable with 60-70% win rate
- Phil Town Rule #1 compliant (don't lose money)
- Conservative position sizing: 2-3 spreads/week

### New Realistic Math

```
2 spreads x $100 x 70% = $140 wins
0.6 losses x $125 (stop-loss) = $75 losses
Net: $65/week = $13/day (floor)
Upside: $25-40/day with good execution
```

## Decision Framework

**Data-driven, not projection-driven:**

1. Paper trade for 90 days
2. Track every trade in `data/spread_performance.json`
3. Use `scripts/track_spread_performance.py` for metrics
4. After 30 trades OR 90 days: evaluate
5. If win rate >=60%: maintain or scale
6. If win rate <60%: reassess strategy

## Key Insight

> "The true eye-opening moment is realizing that the ultimate goal is not a fixed dollar amount, but a reliable, repeatable percentage of growth."

## Prevention

- Always validate targets with math AND real-world data
- Question assumptions that seem too good
- Let paper trading prove strategy before scaling
